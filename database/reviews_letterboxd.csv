7,2020.09.04,"There are so many extraordinary choices here, small and large decisions that make this unusually, almost painfully ambitious movie greater than the sum of all its tiny particles. Nolan seems to be after some unholy alliance of 'Close Encounters' and 'Days of Heaven,' an agrarian family drama vaulted into the cosmos, with a heaping portion of 'Cosmos.' The sequence in which Dr. Mann and Cooper wrestle crosscut with Murph and Tom's showdown on the farm is some of Nolan's finest… more"
10,2021.02.14,"We're just here to be memories for our kids. Still just a miracle of a movie in which Nolan found a way to merge his blockbuster scaled science-fiction imagery with personal ideas about being a father on a dying planet and how his professional/technical passions are directly connected to losing to time with his children, finding a way to package them both as something that contains a bit of The Right Stuff, Solaris, Close Encounters (if we stuck with the… more"

9,2014.11.11,"Nolan's protagonists have always been obsessed explorers of one form or another. Somehow I don't think I realized until now just how much they're driven by loss, battling the universe's unbending laws forbidding the undoing of a past trauma or mistake."

평점 없음,2014.11.12,"Interstellar caused me to go back and revisit Contact. Submitted for you consideration. In the Twilight Zone.  Nolan seeks to ""humanize"" interstellar exploration by giving Kubrick's astronauts a Speilbergian family. Zemekis seeks to humanize interstellar exploration by creating terrestrial bad guys. Does either concept really fly? Kubrick's film works because it is rooted in space. Spielberg's and Zemekis' films work as a terrestrial drama. I prefer the Kubrick approach."

5,2023.07.24,"Expectedly gorgeous. Challenging and overwrought. The movie tried to open my eyes to something deeper so frequently as to feel rote.   Audacious McConaughey. Somewhat puzzling Hathaway. Dion Waiters Damon (for better and worse). Chastain dragging an underwritten character on her back. Classic Nolan.  Thought frequently of Arrival and 2001 while watching this, two films that fans of Interstellar would no doubt say it threads the needle of. For me, it reaches neither the deeply human climax of Arrival nor the cosmic curiosity of 2001. Need to rewatch before banishing it to the “just didn’t work for me” bin.  Sorry Nolan heads."

There’s no mystery to the intent or effect, nothing to interpret, nothing that resists articulation. This is despite his films being about things like dreams, memory, magic, and entering a black hole.

It makes the film ultimately muddled and kind of aggravating, but in the end, it serves to enhance the film's textual conflict between science and faith.

6,2014.11.03,"Both relieved and a little disappointed to discover that I wasn’t the only one to see more Shyamalan than Kubrick or Tarkovsky in this imperfect space odyssey. The clunky dialogue and thin characterizations, the undeniable formal pleasures, the secondhand Spielberg family dynamics, the gooey New Age spirituality—all feel like vintage M. Night. And the twisty climax is swing-away-Merrill ridiculous, overpowering any emotional truth with the sheer power of its absurdity.  I’m right down the middle on this one, to the… more"

It's one of my favorite films of all time, and I'm also a sucker for Christopher Nolan.

Every character is very flat and you don’t know enough about any of them aside from McConaughey‘s to give a fuck whether they live or die.

Interstellar is another spectacle to his formidable legacy. The heavily loaded science gets fed through its dialogues and at times it turns inaccessible, making it tough to stay connected.

10,2018.04.19,Ebertfest 2018 #2 in 70MM.  Christopher Nolan made a $200 million blockbuster that’s not built to sell toys or start a franchise and that’s basically about love.

I think it's amusing that Christopher Nolan took the concept of love and turned it into an abstract scientific force, but the emotional aspects of the film never felt clunky to me.

10,2020.07.15,"Nolan has spent his whole career building elaborate puzzles and imposing them on movie audiences—to their delight and (mostly) to my own frustration. With Interstellar, he took an existing problem - the slow death of our planet and its inhabitants - and, employing his many talents and the talents of his collaborators (and a truckload of quantum physics), he made his masterpiece.  Impossible, but necessary.  Where do I put all the tears I've been choking on for the past hour."

Is it as a good as 2001 or Close Encounters? Yes, because I think it complements them.  I do not like McConaughey. So is it possible that he's incredible in this? Turns out: not possible; necessary.

10,2024.12.06,Nolan just wants as much time as possible to leave behind as many messages as he can for his children and I think that’s beautiful. I get him now

10,2024.09.17,Absolutely perfect film. Stunning every re-watch. Best Nolan for me by a country mile.  Unfathomably moving.
1,2014.11.09,Christopher Nolan switches out his bad dude cynicism for cry-per-half-hour sentimentalism and tough guy utopian science in which we are our future gods. For all of his capacities as Hollywood's leading blockbuster auteur Nolan can't help but turn what reads like a straightforward story on paper into a filmic mess of bizarro mood shifts and environmental indifference (most obvious in his nonsensically edited action sequences and ruthless location shifts). On a formal level Interstellar falls apart when the director attempts… more

Nahhh I really enjoy being a Nolan hater💀 but I did not expect to cry while watching this film, this one really is one of his best.

I knew films were a big part of my life, but it wasn't until I watched Interstellar that I decided I wanted to pursue filmmaking.  Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of modern cinema. He created such a unique concept just like all his original screenplays.  The score is a masterpiece itself, Hans Zimmer is a God amongst men... first film soundtrack I bought on vinyl."

Interstellar in IMAX literally blew my nuts off and sent my body into the 5th dimension. My ears have been blown in smithereens by Hans Zimmer, and I would personally like to send my thanks, and kindly ask that he may do it again. This film is so special. I get it now.  The docking scene literally made me cry because it was so good."

Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema, taking us on a profound voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning as it is intellectually stimulating."
10,2025.02.06,"it isn't possible, no it's necessary  First time watching this film. I know that’s a crime. But I did go see it at the cinema in 70mm.  I was expecting it to be amazing since that’s what everyone says but JESUS CHRIST.. one of the best films I have EVER seen."

I think there’s issues with the writing in this film, the pacing is a slight criticism but can’t complain too much for a nearly 3 hour film. It’s an astonishing cinematic achievement that even though it is a fantastic film is held back by limitations in Nolan’s writing of characters (especially women) and the at times laughable dialogue which will always be a problem with Nolan."

By far one of my favourite films, and seeing it on the big screen was a privilege, especially since I missed it back in 2014.

Nothing much to add to the review I wrote at the time—the stuff that bugged me then (clunky expository dialogue, love as an elementary force we don't yet comprehend, deus ex bootstrap paradox, everything involving Matt Damon) just bugged me even more.

Christopher Nolan’s best definitely. I know film is subjective but I will stand on this. Interstellar will never be removed from my top four.   Also the scene where he watches the recordings of his children after losing 23 years is in my opinion the single best bit of acting I’ve ever seen.   That is all.
