2026.01.21,9.0,"Almost as good as the Emoji Movie. The Emoji Movie is literally the greatest movie ever made and I am not exaggerating at all. From the first second, I was hooked because the colors are super bright and everything looks awesome, like your phone came to life in the best way possible. Emoji City is an amazing place and honestly seems like somewhere I would want to live. The animation is so good that it feels almost real, but better than real. Gene is such a relatable character because he doesn’t fit in, and that teaches an important lesson about being yourself even when people don’t get you. Hi-5 is really funny and a great friend, which proves friendship is important. And Jailbreak is AMAZING. She is smart, brave, confident, and let’s be honest, Jailbreak is hot. She has a cool jacket, cool hair, and a cool personality, which makes her iconic. The movie is funny, meaningful, and exciting the whole time. It deserves way more love and at least a million stars."

2026.01.19,10.0,"Filme perfeito meu Deus. Apesar de ser complexo e difícil de entender, além do final bem agridoce, ainda assim é TÃO bom, sério. Sinto que isso aqui é um divisor de águas pra todo mundo que assiste."
2026.01.19,8.0,"Spoiler alert I writed this in inglish but i from Argentina.(Excusme for my bad inglish,but all person in hére talking inglish) Say that i think the movie was épic.the movie its amazinng cinematographics catches,for ezample when the endurance was beat of Saturn And the pictures of the black hola was cinema.The best thing in the movie was started the exploración of the miller's planet.you feal the ambiet Ana Is épic AND when coper Sayed ""It's necesary"" Is perfect and a detail of when coper leave a dr brand Is the musica Is the same Of when coper leave His son. I understed the reason for a people say what the end Is not god AND i think the end of the movie is'nt perfect.i did talk with a friend of that AND we ending in a one thing.one end best for the movie Is : coper not meet with His daugther AND he did go for the black hole AND coper Is in other universe and tears can say the dates a one space probe And His sacrifice Is More important because His meeting with His daugther isbad"
2026.01.19,6.0,It’s good I guess but the pacing of this movie is bad and definitely boring at times in my opinion.
2026.01.18,10.0,"Rewatched this and it still hits hard. The story, the music, and the space scenes are all amazing. Emotional, beautiful, and mind-blowing every time. 😭🩷"
2026.01.18,9.0,"10/10 movie Pretty high IQ to understand the plot but nothing too complex, the events and how the plot was concluded to save humanity was genius It sends a pretty cool message, and from my interpretation that message was: ""your life is fully in your hands, there is no outside force that will tell you what to do, you have to figure it out and plan your future using your best odds"""
