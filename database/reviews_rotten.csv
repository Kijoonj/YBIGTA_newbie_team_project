17h,5.0,All time favorite film. Beautiful in every way.
1d,5.0,when i have my guy for this i like when the guy have the other man back because he have the best girl voice and they have good cgi and good best movie all time me option. giovanni said 21 jump street is better and he is saints fan for football. but i like this show because it make me cry and like my wifi lag a little bit.
1d,5.0,"Filme perfeito meu Deus. Apesar de ser complexo e difícil de entender, além do final bem agridoce, ainda assim é TÃO bom, sério. Sinto que isso aqui é um divisor de águas pra todo mundo que assiste."
1d,4.0,"Spoiler alert I writed this in inglish but i from Argentina.(Excusme for my bad inglish,but all person in hére talking inglish) Say that i think the movie was épic.the movie its amazinng cinematographics catches,for ezample when the endurance was beat of Saturn And the pictures of the black hola was cinema.The best thing in the movie was started the exploración of the miller's planet.you feal the ambiet Ana Is épic AND when coper Sayed ""It's necesary"" Is perfect and a detail of when coper leave a dr brand Is the musica Is the same Of when coper leave His son. I understed the reason for a people say what the end Is not god AND i think the end of the movie is'nt perfect.i did talk with a friend of that AND we ending in a one thing.one end best for the movie Is : coper not meet with His daugther AND he did go for the black hole AND coper Is in other universe and tears can say the dates a one space probe And His sacrifice Is More important because His meeting with His daugther isbad"
2d,3.0,It’s good I guess but the pacing of this movie is bad and definitely boring at times in my opinion.
2d,5.0,"Rewatched this and it still hits hard. The story, the music, and the space scenes are all amazing. Emotional, beautiful, and mind-blowing every time. 😭🩷"
2d,4.5,"10/10 movie Pretty high IQ to understand the plot but nothing too complex, the events and how the plot was concluded to save humanity was genius It sends a pretty cool message, and from my interpretation that message was: ""your life is fully in your hands, there is no outside force that will tell you what to do, you have to figure it out and plan your future using your best odds"""
3d,5.0,Best Movie to Ever Exist
3d,5.0,"I literally have never been on the edge of my seat this much. It still goes down as my #1 movie OF ALL TIME. If I could watch this again for the first time I would immediately, it’s such a cinematic masterpiece."
5d,2.5,"Mis à part le scénario ""scientifique"", les dialogues sont souvent ridicules et simplistes. La photographie est superbe."
5d,5.0,"5.0 Overall, 4.0 Watchability"
6d,5.0,Awesome movie! One of my all time favorites. Can really make you think and can really trigger some emotions.
6d,5.0,It's one of the best movies I've ever seen
6d,5.0,Best movie of all time
6d,5.0,"Interstellar is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful science-fiction film that blends complex scientific concepts with a deeply human story. Christopher Nolan delivers an ambitious narrative about survival, sacrifice, and love, supported by outstanding performances and an unforgettable score by Hans Zimmer. The film’s exploration of time, space, and human connection leaves a lasting impact, making it both intellectually engaging and emotionally resonant. A modern sci-fi masterpiece."
Jan 12,5.0,"As a movie fanatic as well as a physics/ astronomy major, you need to watch this movie IF and only IF: 1. You like movies 2. You have an active cerebrum 3. Want to watch the argued greatest movie of all time 4. Have ever pondered the idea of added dimensions"
Jan 12,5.0,The best or one of the best movies I have seen.
Jan 11,5.0,"I first watched Interstellar because my dad made me — apparently it’s his favourite movie, and now I get why. Space is massive, time is weird, and Matthew McConaughey goes full dad-mode while piloting through wormholes and ice waves taller than buildings. Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack will emotionally blackhole your soul, making you simultaneously excited, terrified, and on the verge of tears. Cooper’s relationship with Murph hits harder than any asteroid, grounding all the cosmic spectacle in real emotion. The science is intense: relativity, time dilation, gravity… I understood some, panicked at the rest, and decided it’s okay to just feel it. Visually, it’s stunning — planets, black holes, and spaceships that make you question reality. Some dialogue is a bit heavy-handed, and yes, it’s long, but every second serves either the story or your heart. Interstellar is epic, emotional, confusing, hilarious at times, and impossible to forget — basically a masterclass in space and feels."
Jan 11,5.0,Genuinely maybe the best movie I will ever watch. Nothing can compare!
Jan 8,5.0,One of the best movies i’ve ever seen
Jan 8,0.5,"Long. Boring. Time ""THEORITICLY"" works that way, but NOONE CAN SAY, but we make a movie about it. Nice... RLY bad movie, I was unable to finish it."
Jan 8,3.0,"I have a love-hate relationship with Nolan, and this movie sums it up perfectly. Nolan being Nolan, of course he makes a movie about a black hole - and for a while, it feels like it might become one of the greatest hard sci-fi films ever made. Real physics, real relativity, real science, and truly civilizational stakes. And then he breaks his own rules. After grounding everything in real astrophysics and actual black hole simulations, the resolution collapses into metaphysical nonsense, magic time-bookshelves, and a father-daughter melodrama that hijacks what should have remained unknowable, terrifying, and symbolic. Once he enters the black hole, I was hoping for something on a 2001: A Space Odyssey level: abstract, artistic, and open to interpretation. Instead, we get pseudo-science and emotional shortcuts. Somewhere inside this is a masterpiece."
Jan 4,5.0,"I came into this movie expecting a decent story, i was surprised at the amazing acting, the incredible story and good action, also the beyond incredible soundtrack, my third favorite movie"
Jan 4,5.0,"This is the greatest movie I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched hundreds of different movies, ranging from genres to length and to say this is the best movie I’ve ever seen, is an understatement. This has potential to be the greatest movie ever made. The director of this film masterfully made each scene to be memorable. There were very few scenes that are boring and uninteresting. The film director also masterfully creates emotion. Another thing is there are several suspenseful moments that make Interstellar a great movie to watch. I regret not watching this earlier."
Jan 3,5.0,"Uhhhhhhhhhhh, what did I just watch!? I am forever changed and will forever adore this masterpiece of art that Christopher Nolan has blessed the world with! 11/10, my new all time favorite movie"
Jan 2,5.0,Perfection Man & the music is soooo good
Jan 2,5.0,"cinema, absolute cinema."
Jan 2,3.5,"Emotional and gripping but predictable some reveals get you but once you think about it,it absorbs you taking your mind away from the flaws and predictable ending"
Jan 1,4.5,"I just finished this film on a friend's recommendation. I initially thought I hadn't seen it before, but it turns out I definitely had. I might actually watch it a third time just to fully grasp the complex concepts. The story is set in a world where the environment has deteriorated to the point where humanity can no longer survive, making deep-space exploration necessary. Gravity acts as a medium to transfer information from the fifth dimension to the third. I was fascinated by the connection between the bookshelf, Morse code, and binary, still a bit confused about what specific data was actually being transferred. The idea of time becoming a physical, tangible entity is still mind-blowing to me. The film reminds us that we cannot change the past. It struck me that the secret to immortality, which ancient emperors always sought, might actually lie in space, where time is relative. Also, the scene where Cooper sends messages to Murph treminded me of the scene in Harry Potter."
Jan 1,5.0,"One of my all-time favorites. Complex, Scientific, Heart-wrenching, suspenseful and another classic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Some of the concepts in this film might go over some heads and require a little more thinking than some other movies, but I feel like the movie does a good enough job of explaining things like relativity and physics. The actors were all phenomenal and really disappeared into character. The movie does a great job portraying emotional growth and love, as well as difficult emotions and situations like; distance, resentment, forgiveness and the ever moving river of time that we're all on."
Dec 30,5.0,"This is the best combination of cinematography, music, acting and plot that has ever been made"
Dec 30,5.0,"Um antigo piloto está vivendo sua vida normal quando é chamado para uma missão que iria mudar o mundo e, ele não sabia, mas a sua vida também. É incrível ver como o diretor e os roteiristas colocaram o início, o meio e o fim da história de um jeito totalmente inovador, fazendo referências ao próprio filme durante as cenas. A atuação do elenco, os cenários produzidos e utilizados, toda a junção compôs um filme que poderia ser um fracasso, mas que se tornou verdadeiramente uma obra de arte, com muitas reviravoltas, plot's e com certeza muita emoção para um filme que tem um enredo de ficção científica."
Dec 30,5.0,Absolutely spectacular movie. The story was immaculate and an instant classic and the science was mostly accurate which was also something I enjoyed. Kip Thorne and Christopher Nolan did an amazing job
Dec 29,5.0,A film that people talk about way into the future.
Dec 28,5.0,"If I could give Interstellar ten stars, I would without hesitation. This film is a profound, soul stirring journey that transcends science fiction and becomes something deeply human. Every frame feels intentional, from the breathtaking visuals of space to the quiet, intimate moments that carry the emotional weight of the story. Christopher Nolan crafted a cinematic masterpiece that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. The storytelling is bold and expansive, yet grounded in love, sacrifice, and the passage of time. The score elevates every scene, making the vastness of the universe feel both awe inspiring and hauntingly personal. Interstellar is unlike any other film I have ever seen. It challenges the mind, moves the heart, and leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. An epic achievement in filmmaking and a timeless experience."
Dec 28,5.0,I'm a huge movie buff and this is top 3 all time for me of not #1. Great storyline and great acting. This will be a classic for decades to come.

Dec 19,5.0,Nolan makes visually stunning and complex movies! It took me a while to figure this one out. But what a great story. I would definitely recommend this for the science-fiction interested people out there.

Dec 13,5.0,One of my top movies of all time! The soundtrack is up there with the best of them!
Dec 12,4.5,I'm just gonna one word. (Well I mean 2 but nvm) ABSOLUTE CINEMA. Definitely worth it to watch on a pirated streaming service.
Dec 10,5.0,"Masterpiece, good soundtrack, good movie, good evyerthing, transcendance"
Dec 7,5.0,"As a lover of both classical and modern physics, I fell in love with this film. It explains Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in a clear and entertaining way."
Dec 6,5.0,"A masterpiece! What cinematic perfection! This film is a rare gem, one you only see from one director, Nolan. What incredible creativity! The cinematography and acting are superb. Honestly, I watched the film more than once and didn't understand it. I watched it more than once and understood it. Frankly, this is a visual, directorial, and acting masterpiece. My advice: you must watch it in Blu-ray or IMAX to fully appreciate this complex work of art. Regarding the performances, I want to thank everyone who contributed to this film, the wonderful crew, and the legendary performance of Matthew McConaughey. Thank you, Interstellar team, for this masterpiece. My rating for this masterpiece is beyond rating. I've never seen anything like it before, and I will watch it again to understand some points at the end. This film is underrated; it deserves more recognition because it's a complex and meticulously crafted masterpiece. Thank you, Nolan, for this masterpiece and this rare, intricate"
Dec 4,5.0,Peak cinema this is
Dec 2,5.0,"One of those movies that just hirs different. Great soundtrack, cast, plot and special effects. Absolutely perfect, and the ending leaves you thinking everytime"

Nov 29,5.0,SIMPLESMENTE CINEMA
Nov 29,5.0,THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nov 28,5.0,What a masterpiece! This movie set the threshold very high for any Sci-Fi movie to come..
Nov 28,5.0,"Epic in all respects. Stellar cast 😜 who all exceeds convincingly in character. So much effort done to keep it ""scientifically"" correct. Stunning cinematography and visually mind blowing. Thought provoking, intrigue filled, lots of drama, action, emotion and dilemma. A benchmark production in just about every sense of the word"
Nov 23,5.0,"This is the one movie I wish I could see again for the first time, a sci fi movie that combines elements of the human story combined with hard science, and deftly creates a tremendously emotional response. It is vital to go into the movie knowing nothing about it, nor knowing what to expect, so that it can unfold into its mind-blowing revelations. It was designed for IMAX, so best seen on the largest screen you can find. Director Christopher Nolan loves thematic devices, beautiful cinematic wide shots, and as little CGI as possible. Successive viewings reveal so many clues. No dialogue is superfluous and no detail unimportant. A movie that doesn't feel as long as it actually is, because it engages the fully invested viewer."
Nov 23,5.0,"Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of all time, I cried 4 times while watching this movie, having to watch your kids grow up in a couple hours was devastating, Hans Zimmer’s “No time for caution” is memorizing, the visual effects are well done, it looked so real even though it’s was computer graphics, even though there will never be a sequel I just have one question. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?"

Nov 18,5.0,"Just an absolute masterpiece like no other in the history of cinema. Its aesthetics, its fascinating scientific lore, its grim, emotional moments. Just everything about this movie is masterfully crafted. An absolute must-see timelessly relevant to humanity's hardships."

Nov 17,5.0,Flawless acting great plot amazing visuals An emotional experience
Nov 17,5.0,"Visuals: 10/10 – Stunning space imagery, incredible planet designs, and some of the most beautiful shots Nolan has ever done. Soundtrack: 10/10 – Hans Zimmer at his absolute peak. The organ-driven score is emotional, tense, and unforgettable. Science/Worldbuilding: 9/10 – Ambitious and grounded in real physics, but still cinematic and imaginative. Story: 9.5/10 – A mix of hard sci-fi, mystery, and raw human emotion. Big concepts with a surprisingly personal core. Performances: 9.5/10 – Matthew McConaughey is phenomenal. The cast delivers powerful, believable performances all around. Overall, 9.5/10."
Nov 15,5.0,One of the best sci-fi movies ever made.
Nov 15,5.0,Thankful i live in a time when this movie was made. Great cinematics and musical score.
Nov 12,5.0,One of my favorite movies of all time. Terrifying and beautiful at the same time. I love the science and love all wrapped into one. Give it a chance if you’ve never seen it. It might surprise you.
Nov 10,5.0,My favorite space epic. Masterpiece.
Nov 8,5.0,"Interstellar is nothing short of breathtaking. Christopher Nolan delivers a deeply emotional and intellectually stimulating film that blends science, humanity, and love into an unforgettable cinematic experience. The visuals are absolutely stunning — from the haunting beauty of distant galaxies to the awe-inspiring portrayal of a black hole — every frame feels meticulously crafted. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best performances as Cooper, grounding the film’s cosmic scope with raw emotion and humanity. Hans Zimmer’s score is equally spectacular — powerful, haunting, and perfectly attuned to the film’s grand sense of wonder. What sets Interstellar apart is how it balances heart and science. It challenges your mind while tugging at your heartstrings, leaving you contemplating life, time, and the lengths we’d go for love and survival. Whether you’re a sci-fi fan, a lover of great storytelling, or simply someone who appreciates cinema at its finest, Interstellar is a must-watch. A timeless classic that reminds us that “love is the one thing that transcends dimensions of time and space.” 10/10 would absolutely watch again"
Nov 7,5.0,"One of my favorite movies ever, amazing from beginning to end!!"
Nov 6,4.0,"As I've said before, I love a movie that makes you think. Though it has action, this is not a movie for those who need something to veg out with or ignore on your phone. Movies like these demand your attention and don't apologize for it. Beautiful visuals and a message of hope and the power of love against hopelessness and despair resonates with me. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor, turn off the phone and let your yourself be absorbed."
Nov 4,4.0,Good movie recommended
Nov 3,5.0,My all time favorite movie. 98/100
Nov 3,5.0,"Interstellar is a masterfully crafted science fiction epic that seamlessly blends theoretical physics with profound emotional storytelling. Christopher Nolan’s direction, coupled with Jonathan Nolan’s screenplay, delivers a narrative that is both intellectually ambitious and deeply human. The film explores themes of time dilation, gravity, and multidimensional space through the lens of a father-daughter relationship that anchors the story’s emotional core. Matthew McConaughey leads a stellar cast with a performance that is both grounded and compelling, supported by Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. Hans Zimmer’s score is a standout element, elevating the film’s tension and wonder with a composition that is as expansive as the cosmos it depicts. Visually, Interstellar is stunning—its depiction of black holes, wormholes, and distant planets is both scientifically informed and cinematically breathtaking. In sum, Interstellar is a rare achievement: a film that challenges the mind while moving the heart. It stands as a benchmark in modern science fiction cinema and deserves its place among the genre’s finest."
Nov 2,5.0,So good so good so good
Oct 29,5.0,"I didn't like it the first time I watched it. I can't remember why, I am a pretty linear person so it was not working. I've since been listening a lot to the soundtrack and I guess I have aged. This is in the sum of it an excellent movie. The daughter is great, the son is a son. The poem is a driving force. The actors are well chosen. The button, would you use it if it meant life. The robots have a personality. She told them he liked farming. All the small bits. The more you watch it, the more it is enjoyable like a very nice wine. I think anyone who scores this low if they watch it some more it will grow on them."
Oct 28,5.0,Absolutely nothing like it. I’m so happy I saw this come out.
Oct 25,4.0,i really should've seen in theatre imax. the portal was great.
Oct 24,5.0,"I've seen this movie many times, one of the greatest movies of all time, dare I say the greatest...it's up there"
Oct 23,2.5,"I’m watching this today (23/10/25) for the first time, it’s never really appealed to me before! Won’t watch again, I’m glad I finally watched and realised FOMO isn’t a good thing!"
Oct 21,5.0,"Perfect movie, acting, story, music, effect. All top."
Oct 20,5.0,"Fantastic! Sad, complex, gorgeous."
Oct 19,5.0,this is a rewatch but still a stunning and well-paced movie. i had to turn on cc for matthew mcconaughey though bc i could not catch what dude was saying half the time
Oct 19,5.0,"One of the best movies ever made, for some reason the rating is a 73? Why?"
Oct 19,4.5,"Absolutely brilliant, creative, stunning visuals. Great cast and story."
Oct 18,5.0,"Pure cinema. Interstellar is breath-taking, emotional, raw, combining realism with fiction, it is one, if not the best sci-i movie i have watched in my entire life. Interstellar is a genius cinema masterpiece, making you glued to the screen every second. Friendship, fatherhood, betrayal, love. If you’re a fan of space and science, or even movies in general, Interstellar is the best pick you can make. 2 hours and 40 minutes of pure cinema."
Oct 17,5.0,"I have never understood why such a good movie was given a 73% rotten tomatoes. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, blending mind-boggling science that makes you think about the movie (if you have the will to do so) while blending love and persistence. I could not have asked for a better movie. Thank you so much Christopher Nolan."
Oct 15,5.0,"You dare You dare say anything negative about the absolute best movie I have ever seen in my life and the best you will ever see The music, the scenes, the story The scene when he watches his children's messages after coming the edge of the Gargantua I watched the movie 3 times and j always cry in it And the docking scene💀 Man this is the absolute cenima experience This is the best movie I have ever watched in my life Better than inception Better than dark knight"
Oct 14,5.0,Even after a decade my love for this movie is unexplainable. Mind bending visuals and background score. Sentimental. Perfect casting. Nail biting scenes. Excellent screenplay. Best space related sci-fi movie of the decade. Watched a lot of times. Will watch too.
Oct 13,5.0,The best movie I've ever seen. Literally my #1
Oct 13,5.0,This movie was very good and refreshing
Oct 12,5.0,"""Nolan at his best. Awesome!"""
Oct 12,4.5,Absolutely gorgeous movie! Every shot was beautiful and the story wasn’t bad but the ending blew my mind! There were some parts of the movie that felt like the story wasn’t going very slowly so that brings the score down.
Oct 7,1.5,Absolutely boring. One of the worst films Idk. It is beyond me how so many people love this film.
Oct 7,5.0,"Great film, wonderful music, stellar cast and wonderful fusing of sci-fi and humanity. Excellent visually especially watching Matthew McConaughey for nearly 3hrs!! ☺️💜"
Oct 5,3.5,A for Effort but not as smart as it makes out. Better than average Sci fi movie.
Oct 3,5.0,"EPIC SCIENCE FICTION: THE FILM STANDS OUT FOR FASCINATINGLY INTERTWINING REAL LIFE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS SUCH AS TIME DILATION AND BLACK HOLES, WITH AN EPIC NARRATIVE OF SURVIVAL AND SPACE EXPLORATION. VISUAL AND SOUND EXPERIENCE: THE COMBINATION OF STUNNING VISUAL EFFECTS AND HANS ZIMER´S POWERFUL SOUNDTRACK CREATES AN IMMERSIVE AND MOVING ATHMOSPHERE THAT TRANSPORTS THE VIEWER THROUGH SPACE AND HUMAN EMOTIONS"
Sep 30,5.0,Absolutely unlike any movie i have seen
Sep 29,5.0,"Rarely does a film challenge the mind and stir the heart quite like Interstellar. Christopher Nolan creates a monumental cinematic experience, balancing high-concept scientific theories with a profoundly human story about love, loss, and sacrifice. Matthew McConaughey delivers a stellar performance as Cooper, a man torn between his family and his mission to save humanity."
Sep 28,4.5,"Emotionally engaging, sci-fi yet grounded in its characters' motivations. A story revolving around science fiction yet ending on the note of 'it's love, it's about love' in its deeper forms, not just the oversimplified romantic one. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 for me? The ending. The whole point of the movie, Cooper's motivation for the entire mission...and so abruptly he lets it go? It undercuts the emotional payoff."
Sep 26,5.0,The best. Simply. My favorite movie ever.
Sep 25,5.0,SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS
Sep 24,1.0,THE most boring movie I have ever seen
Sep 23,5.0,You can't really express more from humanity than what this film shows. A masterpiece.
Sep 20,4.5,"This movie was a masterpiece, with a jaw dropping plot, breath-taking cinematics, and an amazing storyline overall, there is almost nothing to hate about this movie. Although, I would say this movie is really long, and some people either love it or hate it... no in-betweens."
Sep 20,5.0,"My absolutely favorite movie of all time! McConaughey is brilliant, and it becomes some much more realistic if you read “The Science of Interstellar” by Kip Thorne. Just absolutely brilliant. Recommend to everyone."
Sep 15,1.0,Jarring and convoluted.
Sep 14,5.0,One of the best sci fi movies of this generation.
Sep 13,4.5,A fascinating movie with a fantastic plot that really gets your head spinning. Definitely a must-see and will not disappoint.
Sep 12,5.0,8th grade science class put me on to this one
Sep 10,5.0,"Nothing to dislike, I’m so glad I got to experience this movie in theater."
Sep 9,4.0,Really cool story but a little depressing
Sep 8,5.0,Absolutely PHENOMENAL
Sep 8,4.5,Watched tonight at home. It was definitely great but maybe lacked just a little bit to get me to 5 star. There was several things that lost me. Could be a 5 star on a 2nd watch.
Sep 8,4.5,"After a dodgy start with some exceedingly clunky & exposition-heavy dialog, it's fantastic once humanity's last hope gets into space. The effects are flawless & the story is as thought-provoking as it gets for a major movie. An excellent ending completes the brilliance & for me, this is what movie-making is all about when it's at its best."
Sep 7,2.0,"The science may be spot on (or so I have been told) but the screenplay misses its mark by a mile. When viewed on the big screen the incredibly impressive visuals carry the film (stirring memories of seeing “2001” for the first time). When viewed years later on my screen at home you are all too aware of a script that is primarily exposition, melodrama and implausible contrivances and coincidences."
Sep 7,5.0,Just as good as I remember.
Sep 7,5.0,Incredible experience
Sep 6,5.0,Greatest movie!! Thank you for replaying it!!

Aug 30,5.0,"very slow at times, yet so very impactful. i love everything about this movie from the soundtrack to the cinematography."
Aug 29,5.0,A must see. Speechless. Mind opening. Truly a great movie that mixes a lot of different educations while also making it heart wrenching but spontaneously beautiful. 10/10
Aug 26,5.0,"If you like drama or science fiction, you will absolutely FALL IN LOVE with this movie. I usually hate dramas because they are so cringy but Christopher Nolan always makes the best dramas. Masterpiece of a movie and anyone who thinks otherwise must just hate cinema altogether."
Aug 24,5.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, today I stand before you not to praise a film, but to celebrate a monument. Interstellar is not merely a movie — it is a cathedral of cinema, a towering symphony of sight, sound, and soul. Christopher Nolan did not just direct; he summoned an experience that transcends the screen. The visuals are not special effects, they are visions of infinity itself. The score is not music, it is the heartbeat of the cosmos, shaking us to our very core with every organ note Hans Zimmer unleashes. This is a film that dares to wrestle with the largest questions humanity has ever faced: time, gravity, love, destiny. And it does not whisper — it roars. It drags us into the black hole of despair and hurls us back out into the blinding supernova of hope. At its core, Interstellar is not about space — it is about us. About the fire that keeps humanity alive, about the unbreakable threads of love that outlast galaxies, about the courage to leave the known and step into eternity. Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper is not just a character — he is every parent, every dreamer, every soul that has ever dared to hope for tomorrow. Other films entertain. Interstellar enlightens. Other films tell stories. Interstellar forges myths that feel eternal. Other films end when the credits roll. Interstellar lingers in your bones, in your breath, in your very blood. This movie is not the best of its decade. It is not the best of its century. It is the best ever — because it reminds us of the most essential truth: we are small, yes, but our love, our courage, our will to survive, make us infinite. So when we speak of cinema at its peak, let us not hesitate, let us not falter. The answer is clear, the answer is certain, the answer is eternal: Interstellar is the greatest film ever crafted by human hands. Thank you."
Aug 22,4.0,Great movie. Enjoyed most every scene
Aug 22,5.0,"I am a fan of science fiction, not so much a fan of dramas. But this time, the drama part actually made the movie really shine. And the audio was spot-on, tied it all together perfectly."
Aug 20,5.0,"absolutely cinema, no words enough to describe it"
Aug 20,5.0,Nristopher Crolan is a very good director
Aug 20,5.0,"first english, below spanish: english: the peak of science fiction. christopher nolan signed with 'interstellar' what is, without a doubt, his most ambitious and accomplished work. what unfolds here is a narrative and visual spectacle of unprecedented proportions, where every element aligns with surgical precision to construct an instant classic of modern cinema. the staging reaches heights of grandeur rarely seen in science fiction: settings of overwhelming beauty, visual effects that verge on technical perfection, and cinematography that turns every sequence into a sensory experience. but what is truly admirable is that this monumental scope never loses sight of emotion; the film beats with an intimate and deeply human force that transcends the merely spectacular. the screenplay, with impeccable structure and surprising clarity for the complexity of its themes, stands as one of the most solid and daring works of the last decade. the dialogues, carefully crafted, feel organic, filled with an intensity that deeply resonates with the viewer. the performances, astonishingly natural, reinforce this effect to the point of blurring the line between actor and character. the music by hans zimmer deserves special mention: possibly one of the most powerful scores ever composed. its ability to heighten tension, tear at emotion, and infuse each moment with transcendence makes it an autonomous experience, capable of sending shivers down the spine on its own. with a sustained rhythm that defies its long duration and a finale of overwhelming power, 'interstellar' is not just a space film, it is a cinematic milestone. a turning point in science fiction, rising deservedly to the olympus of contemporary film art. spanish: la cumbre de la ciencia ficción. christopher nolan firmó con 'interstellar' la que, sin lugar a dudas, es su obra más ambiciosa y lograda. lo que aquí se despliega es un espectáculo narrativo y visual de proporciones insólitas, donde cada elemento se alinea con precisión quirúrgica para construir un clásico instantáneo del cine moderno. la puesta en escena alcanza cotas de grandeza pocas veces vistas en la ciencia ficción: escenarios de una belleza sobrecogedora, efectos visuales que rozan la perfección técnica y una fotografía que convierte cada secuencia en una experiencia sensorial. pero lo verdaderamente admirable es que esta monumentalidad nunca pierde de vista la emoción; la película late con una fuerza íntima y profundamente humana que trasciende lo meramente espectacular. el guion, de impecable estructura y sorprendente claridad para la complejidad de sus temas, se erige como uno de los trabajos más sólidos y arriesgados de la última década. los diálogos, cuidadosamente elaborados, se sienten orgánicos, cargados de una intensidad que cala en el espectador. las interpretaciones, de una naturalidad apabullante, refuerzan este efecto hasta el punto de volver difusa la frontera entre actor y personaje. la música de hans zimmer merece mención aparte: posiblemente una de las bandas sonoras más poderosas jamás compuestas. su capacidad para elevar la tensión, desgarrar la emoción y dotar de trascendencia cada instante convierte a la partitura en una experiencia autónoma, capaz de erizar la piel por sí sola. con un ritmo sostenido que desafía su larga duración y un desenlace de potencia demoledora, 'interstellar' no es solo una película espacial, es un hito cinematográfico. un punto y aparte en la ciencia ficción, que se eleva con justicia al olimpo del séptimo arte contemporáneo."
Aug 19,5.0,"i watched this movie recently and i truly regret not watching on a 3 Imax screen. it is honestly one of the best movie i've ever seen. the characters are great, everyone has their motive as to why they are the way they are. the cinematography is out of this world, it really shows how beautiful the universe is and christopher nolan makes a black hole which should be scary into this beautiful object our universe produced. the sound track is stellar, it's amazing and hans zimmer does it again with it beautiful piano and composing. the movie is a whole study about humanity and our universe, for someone who isn't familiar with science, this movie makes us explore, curious and research about bits of our existence. a truly amazing experience and movie"
Aug 19,5.0,"A timeless, mind-bending and visually transcendent cosmic odyssey about space, time and love, defined by astonishing performances and Hans Zimmer’s iconic score. Since watching it for the first time in 2014, I’ve made it a tradition to rewatch it at least once a year to remind myself of the true definition of a masterpiece."
Aug 18,5.0,It is one of the few films in which the fear of the future is constant; its blend of scientific essence and what we would so far define as ‘fantasy’ intertwine to create a great cinematic arc.
Aug 17,5.0,I can watch this movie time after time. Glad I was alive to see it. Matthew McConaughey is legendary.
Aug 16,5.0,One of my top 10 movies of all time. Intriguing and thought provoking. I got invested in this movie and felt all the feels.
Aug 15,5.0,"The greatest movie of all time imo, seen it around 100 times, no exaggeration, gets better everytime."
Aug 15,5.0,The best everrrrrrrrr
Aug 12,4.0,"Initially, I didn't think I'd watch this more than once, but over time it has grown on me. Not the best of it's kind, but it is worth at least one watch for sure!"
Aug 12,5.0,"Scored 73% given by critics, shows how some of them literally don't understand cinema. One of the greatest movie ever made"
Aug 11,5.0,"One of the best films I've ever seen. I must have watched it ten times. Full of subliminal messages, the perfect integration of science and fiction. Perfect cast and performances. I intend to watch it again."
Aug 11,5.0,"Interstellar is my favorite film. Nolan is a master like few others, and as a father of two girls, this film connected with me emotionally. I love this film, its soundtrack (Hans Zimmer never disappoints), its rhythm, its art. Don't miss it if you haven't already."
Aug 11,5.0,"Excelente, una pieza de arte. No te cansas de verla"
Aug 10,4.0,"Christopher Nolan complicates matters in a very entertaining way as Matthew McConaughey and Crew venture across space and time and test the resolve of humankind in an attempt to save planet Earth. Meanwhile, Michael Caine displays his genius at acting back home. It’s understandable that the complications in the movie could cause an audience to wane slightly in interest, but the story remains gripping, and the action is turbulent and riveting in every good way."
Aug 10,5.0,Watching this in a 70mm IMAX is like living in a dream
Aug 9,4.5,"AMAZING MOVIE! Loved it! Confusing in terms to knowing about space, etc. but the cinematic and storyline is great. You have to pay attention"
Aug 9,4.5,"Interstellar isn’t just a sci-fi flick; it’s a meditation on time, survival, and what truly drives us forward. Powerful, awe-inspiring, and deeply human."
Aug 7,3.5,"Honestly, I expected more from this movie."
Aug 7,5.0,Best sci-fi movie of all time
Aug 4,5.0,Scientifically accurate and dramatically beautiful.
Aug 3,0.5,"Horrible movie waste of 3 hrs do not watch, bunch of space dorks competing for who can out dork the other dork. Makes absolutely 0 sense very hard to follow did not have one emotion run through my body while watching and was utterly bored. The fact this has such high reviews shows me how many super dorks are out in the world."
Aug 2,5.0,"Beyond the stunning visuals and the epic Nolan-style scenario, this movie becomes a masterpiece thanks to the deeply emotional father-daughter relationship. Amazing work from McConaughey, and the music by Hans Zimmer brings it to the next level."
Aug 2,1.0,What is this monstrosity.
Aug 2,5.0,Biased opinion: Best Movie Of All Time. Unbiased opinion: Still The Best Movie Of All Time.
Aug 2,5.0,An emotional and powerful journey that displays heartwarming themes. Visuals are scientifically accurate and stunning. The score by Hans Zimmer elevates it all.
Aug 1,5.0,One of the GOATs you can’t go wrong watching this
Jul 31,5.0,"I watched ""Interstellar"" and it's a MASTERPIECE This movie is not boring, interesting, it has a great plot and it is also just great filmed christopher nolan did a great job. This movie may not be for everyone because to understand it you need to think. My rating for this movie is 10/10"
Jul 31,5.0,Science fiction masterpiece. 💯
Jul 31,5.0,"What sets this apart from all the other Sci-Fi slop that floats about contemprorary media was how real it felt, nothing about the emotion conveyed in this move was fiction, it's message, it's story and acting all felt real and the lack of the heavy CGI made added to how well the movie looked and felt."
Jul 30,5.0,"Una de mis películas favorita, esta película me dejó impactado con todos los efectos visuales que agregaron, y su historia es perfecta. Esto se merece una secuela si se pudiese."
Jul 30,5.0,"impecável. com certeza um dos melhores filmes que já vi, com reviravoltas emocionantes e inesperadas, um enredo fenomenal e história insuperável. obra de arte!!"
Jul 29,5.0,"I don't know how else to put it, this film genuinely changed my life. I have never seen things the same since I watched it, and it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've found that a lot of science fiction goes too far, but this one makes us think about time, space and what it means to be human while still holding onto a sense of reality. In my personal opinion, the best part about it was the comment on mortality, sacrifice and human connection-- and don't even get me started on the score! I still can't listen to it without being moved to tears. I know some people thought it was ""too sad"" or far fetched but I think it was really well done."
Jul 29,5.0,perfect. need I say more?
Jul 29,5.0,absolute cinema 🤩🤩🤩
Jul 28,5.0,The movie of the century. A master piece of science and cinema!
Jul 28,5.0,"Such a Magnum Opus for both Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan. The movie has such a chilling and urgent feel the whole way through... it just feels like you're watching something important and beyond your understanding. I've seen it a good 6+ times now, including in IMAX for the re-release, and the 23 years of messages scene still makes me cry every time. I'll also never forget how absolutely captivated I was when the wormhole first appeared on screen, only to be even more so when we got our close-ups of Gargantua. The movie is so good that sometimes you forget that even the small details are captivating... take the fact that TARS and CASE are both equally likeable and funny but fit so seamlessly into the story that you don't even consider how impressive that is for a 3-piece robot with a voice. I think most of the (few) bad ratings come down to a lack of understanding of the science that went into this film. It's theoretically possible the entire way through which makes it even more mind-bending. If you haven't seen this, watch it with the volume up and with a box of tissues nearby. My favorite movie of all time by a long shot."
Jul 28,4.5,"A movie so carefully thought out with so much emotion. Although the ending may have confused some people, I think that the rest of the movie makes up for the ending. A pleasant surprise."
Jul 27,3.0,"I fear this movie did not live up to the exact height it was set at. That being said, its a good film. Not something I will think too hardly about when I go to bed at night but not something I regret watching. Matthew McConaughey really made the film what it is, outstanding job! I wish we saw more of the emotional impact of missing all these years, I felt this was brushed over too quickly."
Jul 27,5.0,"Interstellar is a breathtaking masterpiece—visually stunning, emotionally powerful, and thought-provoking. Nolan delivers an unforgettable story about love, sacrifice, and the survival of humanity. My favorite movie of all time."
Jul 27,5.0,"This is the best science fiction film ever created in the film industry. It fascinated me with the study of stellar and supermassive black holes and other areas of modern physics. The story may start off a bit timid, but I guarantee it builds to some truly engaging, exciting, and surprising moments. The film's soundtrack is impeccable, and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne's help with the script and post-production of the visual effects will take the audience's breath away."
Jul 27,5.0,"Interstellar isn't a movie that you forget. It is strikingly beautiful, fantastically immersive, and tells a masterpiece of a story. This movie is by far my favorite of all time."
Jul 27,5.0,Hands-down the most beautiful cinematography and soundtrack I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
Jul 26,5.0,"The best movie of all time, and when you doubt it, just rewatch it!"
Jul 26,5.0,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest movie I have ever seen. I recommend it to everyone. Even if you aren't into astronomy, this movie will rope you in and take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. Some of the greatest acting and cinematography out there. Nolan is a mastermind and McConaughey played his role perfectly."
Jul 26,5.0,This movie is amazing. It made me cry by watching the sad scenes. Best sci-fi movies ever.
Jul 25,5.0,A beautiful movie <3
Jul 25,5.0,"My favourite movie of all time. It’s so good. The music, the story, the visuals. It may get critiqued for not being totally accurate to real physics, but it’s ok. That’s not a problem at all for someone like me who just enjoys the movie for the movie"
Jul 25,5.0,"The greatest movie of all time in my opinion it has everything you could want in a movie , thrill , story. Sadness , redemption, so darn great watched it 12 times"
Jul 25,5.0,"Interstellar is not simply about space. It is about love stretched thin across light years, about time slipping through fingers like dust, and about the quiet ache of what we leave behind. The science holds together better than most. There are liberties, but the film never feels careless. It truly invites the viewer to wonder, rather than simply to watch. What stays with me is not the theory but the feeling. As a father, I find the bond between Cooper and Murph almost too much to bear. The silence of years, the helpless distance, the hope left behind like a message in a bottle is difficult to forget. The music is absolutely remarkable. Zimmer’s score does not merely accompany the film; it gives indescribable breath and depth. The solemn rise of the organ feels less like an instrument and more like a voice from elsewhere. My wife walked down the aisle to one of its quieter passages, and even now, I cannot hear it without having to gain my composure. Interstellar dares to reach beyond the usual bounds. It is clever, vast, thought-provoking, and, perhaps, as close to perfect as film can be."
Jul 24,5.0,"The film is incredible, the special effects they give it are simply spectacular, the themes they show us are impressive and as the film progresses, more things from the beginning begin to make sense, it is a spectacular film. Juan Camilo Reyes Rodríguez 1003"
Jul 24,5.0,"This movie is truly special. The visuals are amazing, the story is heartfelt and brilliant. Overall this is one of my favorite films."
Jul 23,5.0,Love it made me cry

Jul 23,5.0,This is the best movie of the history
Jul 23,5.0,Absolute cinematic masterpiece! A must-see film.
Jul 22,5.0,"As visually stunning as it is deeply thought provoking. Thoroughly, undeniably brilliant."
Jul 22,4.5,"Filmaço, ambientação maravilhosa, historia magnifica com seus pontos altos simplesmente incriveis, so não perca nenhum minuto do filme ou você não entenderá mais nada. DON'T LET ME LEAVE, MURPH!"
Jul 20,4.0,This is Christopher Nolan’s only emotional movie really and damn dose he sucssed
Jul 19,5.0,"Awesome, gorgeous , Total worth it to watch"
Jul 19,5.0,Best movie ever can't be better
Jul 19,5.0,An amazing movie with an amazing story.
Jul 18,5.0,"Un largometraje que te recuerda que todo puede recuperarse, menos el tiempo y el gran valor de estar con los que amamos...grandiosos efectos y soundtrack, una delicia de principio a fin."
Jul 17,5.0,"Thoughtful, emotional, captivating and suspenseful. easily the best work of Christopher Nolan and, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made."
Jul 17,5.0,"Christopher Nolan’s own 2001: A Space Odyssey, with a brilliant, emotional and constantly misunderstood plot. Truly a work ahead of its time."
Jul 17,5.0,"Interstellar is an epic journey about saving humanity when Earth is no longer enough. A group of explorers travels beyond the stars, facing time, space, and their own limits. Visually stunning and emotionally deep, it’s a story that makes you think—and feel. JORGE FRANCO"
Jul 16,5.0,"A Journey Through Time, Love, and Memory. I don’t exactly remember the first time I watched Interstellar, but it was probably in 2014 or 2015. I also couldn’t say how many times I’ve seen it because it’s probably too many to count. Today, after almost a decade of loving it, I’m going to watch it for the first time in IMAX, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its release. The movie tells the story of Cooper, who, with the help of his daughter, embarks on an adventure where he becomes the one chosen to save humanity. More than just a simple story based on the typical “hero’s journey,” Interstellar offers a wide range of complex themes to reflect on. It is a movie deeply influenced by science. Since it’s about space travel, the filmmakers made sure everything shown on screen was as realistic as possible. This wouldn’t have been achievable without the work of Kip Thorne. Not only did he manage to bring a realistic black hole to life for the first time, but he also contributed to making other scenes iconic, such as the journey through a wormhole, the visit to Miller’s planet, or the enigmatic Tesseract. I understand that for many people, the ending—or more specifically, the Tesseract scene—can be confusing or even nonsensical. I’ve read many critiques about how love ends up being the key to this story. However, for me, the Tesseract scene and everything related to love in this movie are entirely necessary. I feel it gives the film a touch that is perhaps out of the ordinary or unexpected, something only Interstellar could achieve. Yes, I acknowledge it’s an ambitious story, but connecting the entire narrative through time in Murph’s room, represented as a Tesseract, is simply ingenious. To all this scientific accuracy, a deeply emotional story is added, especially the relationship between a father and his daughter, which is the emotional core of the film. And here lies one of the movie’s most powerful messages: ""Love is the one thing that we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space."" This phrase perfectly encapsulates the essence of Interstellar. The powerful score by Hans Zimmer elevates the experience, creating compositions that not only accompany the film but transcend it, becoming a part of popular culture, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s impossible not to highlight the screenplay by Jonathan Nolan and the direction by Christopher Nolan. Together, they created a masterpiece that, at least for me, wouldn’t have had the same impact without their impeccable vision. In 2014, my father passed away. It was a devastating experience that not only marked my life but also forced me to grow up and see the world from a completely different perspective. When I first watched Interstellar, whether it was that same year or the next, I couldn’t help but relate it to my loss. The story of a father who leaves with the heartbreaking possibility of never seeing his daughter again touched me deeply. The scene where Cooper reunites with his daughter impacted me in a way I had never experienced in cinema before. It was as if, for a moment, I could relive the connection I had lost. Every time I watch it again, those emotions resurface with the same intensity, making Interstellar more than just a movie for me: it’s a reflection of my feelings and memories. Interstellar isn’t simply my favorite movie because I think it’s good; it’s my favorite because of everything it represents for me and the way it marked an important stage in my life. I love the way time is used in this film. So much so that after watching it, time became something I think about constantly to this day. As Professor Brand says: ""I'm not afraid of death. I'm an old physicist - I'm afraid of time."" If someone like me is looking for movies that blend science, emotion, and a deep message, I can’t recommend this masterpiece enough. It’s a unique experience that not only invites reflection but also leaves a mark in the deepest parts of the heart. I’m sure that, like me, those who watch it will find something special that makes it unforgettable."
Jul 15,5.0,"Hernan David Chaparro Rojas A deep film that blends science, love, and hope. Visually stunning with an unforgettable soundtrack. The story questions time, space, and Family bonds. It makes you reflect on humanity’s future. Perfect for those who love emotional."
Jul 15,4.5,minus half because the blackhole is so impossible to be real which makes the movie soft
Jul 15,5.0,10/10 movie. Makes me feel so many emotions
Jul 14,5.0,Best movie I have ever watched in my life. It has complex dilemman and is an emotional ride. It brings you to see Lifes beauty and the cherish your relatives whilst you still have them. Truly a tear shedder for me.
Jul 13,4.5,"Interstellar quenches your thirst for a heartfelt epic, while still managing to be thought-provoking and intellectual. Intersellar is one of those movies that you will make your kids and grandkids watch with you."
Jul 12,2.0,It’s hard to see in dome.
Jul 12,5.0,An Absolute Masterpiece. One of the best things to be ever put on screen.
Jul 12,5.0,This is a hot take but best movie of all time
Jul 12,5.0,"Such a beautiful movie that delivers such a strong message about human connection, love, and family. Another great Nolan classic where the big theme is family. Cooper inspired so many, and his love for Murph just broke my heart. Incredible graphics, beautiful acting, and unforgettable story. If you love sci-fi and space-travel movies, Interstellar should be your #1 on the list."
Jul 10,5.0,"Incredible movie , just watched it in jul 10th 2025"
Jul 9,5.0,"A film that will always invoke wonder as you take to the stars. What makes this so special is at the center of this Gargantuan blockbuster is the story of the relationship between a father and child. In the end, we all cling to the promises our guardians make to us."
Jul 8,5.0,"This film is good, it is slow, and very mind boggling, but that also makes it great. it has such emotional depth with Cooper. it can be gut wrenching. It truly felt like a mystery every step of the way. If you love space and Drama this is the movie for you."
Jul 6,5.0,"The best movie I have ever seen. I keep searching the feelings that this movie maked in me when I seen it, and I haven't found them. 10/10 OBVIOUSLY MUST-SEE."
Jul 6,5.0,Fyeeeee. Favorite movie
Jul 6,3.0,"I can see why it has a 73%, due to stilted or overly sentimental dialogue, huge chunks of it that don’t make much sense to science, heavy exposition and overall a shitty script. However, it has groundbreaking visual effects that still look good today and are the best practical effects since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Speaking of 2001, Interstellar has been heavily influenced by it. For example: the wormhole, the designs, the blow the bolts part, and the AI. In fact, it’s so influenced that it loses originality. Now, back to the pros. The film is very well acted and the character bond scenes between Cooper and his daughter Murphy are (mostly) when the script doesn’t’t screw up. It also has good tension, a good start and end as well. It also has good scientific accuracy when it makes sense. That’s about all the pros, but there are a couple of last few cons. The film is so damn long and it drags, and by the climax you are so exhausted by emotion tension that it hard is a climax. In fact, it feels like a trilogy, and it’s almost long enough to be a trilogy. It’s already long enough to be 2 films. Overall, it’s fine, but it’s flaws are still massive as hell. At least 2001 had minimal plot holes and made sense if you watched it several times, but this can’t and never will live up to the cinematic masterpiece that changed cinema forever, but it is not bad by any means."
Jul 6,5.0,Awe-inspiring...powerful...epic.
Jul 4,4.5,"Arguably one of the best films of the century, complete with incredible acting, ground-breaking visual effects & taut direction. Not to mention, it literally forwarded science in regards to what we know about space."
Jul 3,5.0,"I get bored easily with this genre, but interstellar is cinema, wow, leaves you wanting more"
Jul 3,5.0,a cinematic spectacle unrivaled in breadth and tone. there is equal parts subtext and character nuance buried deep in this emotional opus by the master christopher nolan. what if love transcends space like gravity and time?

Jun 25,5.0,"Simplemente increíble, es una de esas películas que uno debe ver antes de dejar este mundo. Ya dejando el deleite, la película es muy buena en cuanto a realismo, en sus personajes y la física que se habla en la misma, mientras que el mensaje e intención de la película tiene notas melancólicas, eso sí, la película te pone nervioso varias veces, así que una pequeña advertencia a quienes tengan problemas del corazón."
Jun 22,5.0,"Interstellar isn’t just a film — it’s an experience that stays with you. You watch it once for the story, and again for what it quietly tells you."

Jun 19,5.0,this is absolutely amazing movie i ever had
Jun 18,3.0,"An interesting concept and a touch of 'Sixth Sense' but I did find it over long and slow. I couldn't help being distract by the fact that Anne Hathaway's geometric hair cut, that could only have been cut by a skilled hair dresser, didn't change - at all, not even a quarter inch of growth - all the way through the film."
Jun 13,5.0,"Greatest movie of all time, best cinematography, best acting, best musical score, but most of all it really makes you think about life."

Jun 3,5.0,"This is such a great movie. Technically complex and compelling. The characters are incredible, and the relationships between the main character and his children is profoundly moving. The arc of the story is very satisfying and the music is perfect for the film. Great themes that are so relevant for our times with so many quotable lines.

May 23,1.5,"Low grade hollywood dialogue, a little bit of the Batman voice from Matthew, terrible acting/directing for poor Anna Hathaway who ruins the movie with an unbelievable performance, though she was trying her best, the dialogue, the whole thing, is EFFECTS BASED with famous faces, to draw you into a long, boring LAMENESS."
May 22,5.0,WOW got to see it in 70mm!
May 22,5.0,A true Masterpiece. story telling at it's finest with amazing visuals
May 21,5.0,"Interstellar is more than just a science fiction film — it’s a deeply emotional exploration of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit. Christopher Nolan delivers a visually stunning and intellectually ambitious masterpiece that reaches for the stars while staying grounded in heart and humanity. The performances are outstanding, with Matthew McConaughey delivering one of his most powerful roles. Hans Zimmer’s score is a force of its own — haunting, beautiful, and unforgettable. The visuals are jaw-dropping, but it’s the film’s emotional core that truly sets it apart. Interstellar dares to ask big questions about our place in the universe while never losing sight of what makes us human. It’s a film that demands your attention — and rewards it with an experience that’s both epic and deeply personal. A modern sci-fi classic that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
May 21,4.5,"Incredible. Such an amazing writting and not to mention the visuals and the use of the camera. You are going to be amazed for sure with all these ""physics"" ideas and knowledge that the film manages (even though there is obviously fiction). Well written characters, mind blowing stuff everywhere and a sad or ""we did it, but at what cost?"" ending. P.D. Amazing music"
May 20,1.5,"This movie is frustrating, depressing, abstract and entirely too long. The music is the only good part of this movie."
May 20,2.0,"The movie is too long and for some reason is very complicated for no reason at all. Mankind is not made for any other world. We do not have to mess with space and time. And definitely no need to send ourselves from the present just so we could talk to ourselves in past and change the future, lol. It will never work. And also, I would never leave my baby for anyone..."

May 14,4.0,"The visuals, the music and the performances were all fantastic but the story not so much."
May 13,5.0,"Christopher Nolan delivers yet another cinematic masterpiece with Interstellar. This breathtaking film, anchored by a mesmerizing performance from Matthew McConaughey, transcends the boundaries of space and time, urging viewers to ponder the vastness of the universe and the profound beauty of life. It’s a story that stirs the soul, leaving you in awe of both human connection and the wonders that lie beyond our world. As the film poignantly reminds us, “Love is the one thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.” Genuinely the greatest movie ever made, with a soundtrack that is nothing short of perfection. Rating: 10/10"
May 9,5.0,I am glad I got to re-watch it in 70mm. Still like it as much as I liked it the first time I watched it.
May 8,5.0,One of the best movie of all time
May 6,5.0,"Intersteller is an absolute masterpiece, from the visuals to the emotions that I have never experienced in a movie before. The direction is just perfect. This movie definitely makes you think and question what is real and what is sci-fi. Not a movie for the faint hearted."
May 4,5.0,Definitely my favorite movie of all time
May 2,2.5,"I’m a fan of Nolan’s work, but I find this film to be highly overrated. The script feels contrived and overly sentimental, seemingly crafted more to emotionally manipulate the audience than to tell a coherent story. Despite a top-tier cast, the performances come off as surprisingly mediocre."
May 2,5.0,Absolute Masterpiece!
Apr 29,1.5,Marvel is on a steep decline
Apr 28,5.0,Just as good as I remembered it. A true sci-fi film.
Apr 27,5.0,"Visually stunning, emotional storytelling, clever concept. Yet another masterpiece from Nolan."
Apr 25,5.0,This movie shocked me i thought it was going to be a fun movie but the plot twist was so shocking it made it one of my favorite movies.
Apr 22,5.0,Absolut Beauty and Incredible Masterpiece from Christopher Nolan!
Apr 21,5.0,Hermosa película la mejor de ciencia ficción que he visto tiene todo y te llena de sentimientos y con un vacío
Apr 21,5.0,One of if not the best movie I have watched 10/10
Apr 20,5.0,"Interstellar isn’t just a sci-fi movie; it’s an experience. The visuals are insane, the soundtrack is unreal, and the story hits way deeper than you expect. Yeah, it’s a little complex at times, but that’s part of what makes it so good. It’s not just about space travel; it’s about love, time, and what we’re willing to sacrifice. Easily one of the most powerful films I’ve ever seen."
Apr 18,5.0,"Interstellar is hands down my favorite movie. As someone who's deeply interested in science, space, and research, it completely blew my mind. The way it blends real scientific theories with emotional storytelling is just brilliant. Watching the characters travel through wormholes, experience time dilation, and explore unknown planets felt like a dream come true for a space enthusiast like me. It’s more than just a sci-fi movie—it made me think, wonder, and feel all at once."
Apr 17,5.0,The best Christopher Nolan film I love it
Apr 13,5.0,Absolute must watch. Every time I watch this movie I'm just drawn into the world of Cooper.
Apr 13,5.0,Um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos.
Apr 13,5.0,this Movie Is probably the Best Movie I have seen so Far. I would give this a 1000 Stars if I could
Apr 13,4.5,"Interstellar is a timeless sci-fi classic. With his signature narrative structure, editing, and visual language, Christopher Nolan brings an unprecedented sense of beauty and philosophical depth to the space film genre."
Apr 13,5.0,absolute cinema......
Apr 12,4.5,mcconaug-hey there! he's in space!
Apr 11,4.0,Very good. Well made.
Apr 7,5.0,"Honestly, it's pretty funny that the audience scores for this are the same as the Minecraft movie. That just goes to show how this platform might not be the best when regarding objective scores. But that's what IMDb is for. Still, incredible movie can't say nothing more."
Apr 7,1.5,"The soundtrack is so unbearably loud that it drowns out a lot of the mumbled dialogue between characters. The final revelation is filled with hubris and left me wondering why it needed nearly 3 hours just to get there. Also, I read in an interview with Elon Musk that this is his favorite movie. I hope that he was joking when he said that. Overall, a lovely Sunday afternoon spent on something that proved to be not worth the effort or lost time. There's no space-time wormhole for that!"
Apr 7,5.0,"Best movie I ever watched in cinema, it's just a piece of art."
Apr 5,4.0,I thought it was excellent and out of this world 🚀
Apr 5,5.0,such an incredible movie to bad i didnt watch it sooner 1yr=7hr/10 jk 11/10
Apr 4,5.0,"The best movie I’ve ever seen in my life. I seriously can’t get why some people dislike it, maybe they just don’t understand it."
Apr 4,4.5,"Interstellar is a banger of a movie. I have never seen a movie where, after watching it, my heart starts beating crazy for the next couple of days, feeling traumatized about what I just witnessed. The great thing I love about Interstellar is how scientifically accurate it is. I love all the characters and visuals. The only particular flaw I have with this movie is that there are some dull scenes. But this movie still shocked me. Overall, 9/10."
Apr 3,5.0,A must see sci-fi masterpiece.
Apr 3,5.0,Best movie I ever seen.
Apr 3,4.5,The title in the movie is INTERSTELLAR. The director is Christopher Nolan and leads accord are Matthew McConaughey Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway. The movie release in twenty eleven ( 2011 ). The story take about the earth is hard to life but 4 astronaut went wormhole. The astronaut are going to saved the earth?? The acting is very interesting because the main character play between the sadness and enjoy. The setting is very beautiful exemple for the scene in field the director plantes 500 acres of Hector . Finaly the movie is interesting because is a subject current affairs with the hurricane in USA.
Apr 1,5.0,"Interstellar is a movie I can watch over and over again and never lose interest. It is the perfect mix of sci-fi, drama, and action with a great story that leaves you laughing, crying, sitting at the edge of your seat, and hoping it never ends."
Apr 1,5.0,I dont know what you are looking in reviews instead of watching the movie
Apr 1,4.0,Interstellar is stellar! Its one of my go to movies. Soundtrack is great. Father daughter dynamic is touching . Trips in space do not disapoint.
Mar 29,5.0,you must see this film before you die!
Mar 29,4.0,"my favorite movie of all time, watched it for the first time a few weeks ago. i hate myself for not getting to see it in theatres. i love everything about this movie and it honestly changed my life"
Mar 28,5.0,"Arguably my favorite movie of all time. every single thing about it. I don't know what it is or how he does it, but Christopher Nolan delivered. If you haven't seen this movie, I totally recommend. One of the best Sci-Fi thrillers to ever grace media."
Mar 28,5.0,"Directed by the geant Christopher Nolan, Interstellar tells the story of Matthew McConaughey. The character is a retirement astronaut. With her daughter Murph, they find a message of the nasa, for save the people and find an other planet with other astronauts. The plot seems to be absorbing. The specials effects are just incredible, we forgot that the movie is make with green background and the photography he’s impressive. Than the acting performance, there is nothing to tell about just spectacular !! When I watch the movie I crying all my tears, laugh, irritated. Finally, I find this film incredible, maybe the best film ever. Just watch and you will love it !"
Mar 25,5.0,"Interstellar is another movie where Christopher Nolan hits the ball out of the park. Between the absolute beauty that is the music by Hans Zimmer, and the absolute top-tier acting performance that Matthew McConaughey delivers (especially those yells and cries my god), it is a must-watch for any fan of space exploration. Christopher Nolan's Sci-fi adventure is also surprisingly more science than fiction. The way he uses no sound when you're looking at the movie from space is peak genius. My only real negative is that the movie's length is a bit tedious, and while watching it the first hour is definitely the hardest to get through due to massive exposition dumps. But when you finish the movie, it does feel very complete and everything comes full circle. The pacing is near exceptional, however, do pay attention to details the movie drops because like my algebra class, this story flies like a rocket. Now onto spoiler territory, the concept of wormholes and time dilation is stellar, not pun intended. The way Cooper just sacrifices himself by going into the tesseract felt like the scene was shooting bullets at my heart. And the pure emotion Matthew McConaughey is putting into his voice when he's telling Murphy to stay could make the toughest grown men cry, I'm sure of it. Overall, if you're looking for an emotional space movie, and you're willing to sit through nearly 3 hours of adventure, Interstellar is the perfect watch."
Mar 25,5.0,"No amount of words or phrases can even begin to describe the masterpiece that is Interstellar. I have seen this film several times before watching it in theaters but let me just say it is an indescribable feeling getting the chance to watch this in the theater, in IMAX nonetheless. I truly felt transported. Interstellar pushes our views as well as our thoughts beyond time and space and out as far as other dimensions. It allows us to go beyond the limit of our knowledge regarding space and time and travelling through them and to think deeper than just what is on our own planet. You just have to be willing to look up at the sky and wander and be willing to explore."
Mar 25,4.5,This movie is long but epic. Clumsy in some spots but generally enjoyable and the payoff at the end is well worth the time invested.
Mar 23,5.0,The music incredible.
Mar 22,5.0,"10/10! I wish I could watch the movie for the first time, just to experience the amazing crescendo of storytelling all over again. From the performances to the dialogue to the scoring and of course the cinematography, this movie is a masterpiece and has earned its right to be called a “cult classic”."
Mar 22,5.0,This movie is so good. It has such a good twist at the end that made me go (°д°). Go on and watch it.
Mar 21,5.0,"The plot unfolds mysteriously. The depth, the originality, the acting, the visuals, the atmosphere, you can watch it multiple times."
Mar 21,5.0,"Probably one of the greatest movies I ever seen in my life. It makes you wonder, what is and what isn’t reality."
Mar 21,5.0,One of if not the best movie I've ever seen.
Mar 20,3.5,"I’m not sure what the hype is over this movie. Yes, I am a Christopher Nolan fan and a Matthew McConaughey fan, but there’s something about this that doesn’t hit the way it should. Maybe it’s pretending to be a movie with a deep meaning or MM’s constant mumbling but I don’t like it as much as I thought I would."
Mar 20,5.0,"This is one of the greatest sci-fi movies I've ever seen. It had beautiful and stunning visuals, and its story was intriguing. I highly recommend this for fans of sci-fi!"
Mar 19,3.0,"Thought provoking, yes. But equally headache provoking when I found myself hopelessly adrift in the abstractions of quantum mechanics and theoretical physics. I got the gist of the narrative but the finer points were lost on me. Way too much thrown at the audience in the span of two hours that felt more like a hundred years. The only thing that kept me watching were the special effects and those ridiculous looking robots."
Mar 19,5.0,"Best movie of all time. Everything about it to the last detail is amazing, music just heavenly and even more in IMAX 70MM.. movie will never get old no matter how many times I watch"
Mar 18,5.0,I thought this movie was very though provoking and a great sci-fi movie that has a lot of real world implications.
Mar 17,5.0,"I loved this movie. It was super emotional and I was all in once it started. I think that certain characters were unnecessary and I didn’t understand their motives but visually, this might be the best movie I’ve ever seen."
Mar 17,5.0,"Never in my life i experienced this kind of thing, the re releasing experience was on another level this kind of movies are literally made once in an lifetime."
Mar 16,5.0,One of the greatest Sci-fi movies of all time!
Mar 16,2.5,"A grossly overrated science fiction film with some compelling real-life scientific concepts, but addled with ludicrous fantasy, contrived melodrama, and bleak cynicism disguised as optimism."
Mar 15,5.0,One the greatest movies there is!
Mar 15,1.0,"The premise had promise, it could have been a good movie, instead they made it hokey and stupid."
Mar 15,5.0,Everything I expected and then some. I wish I got the chance to see it one more time in IMAX! Already looking forward to the 20th anniversary. Most beautiful movie ever.
Mar 14,5.0,"My favorite movie, the plot is slow at the beginning, but it's good in the middle"
Mar 14,5.0,"Everything about this movie is amazing! From the cinematography, special effects and the music. Just perfect! Cast is excellent as well."
Mar 14,5.0,Interstellar was and still one of the best movies I've ever watched in my whole life and I think there's no other banger that could stand this masterpiece.
Mar 13,5.0,My favourite film of all time! So chilling to know that the money/ research that went into this helped science. Such an epic tale and it’s so amazing to know this was part of something bigger!
Mar 12,5.0,by far the best sci-fi movie without the fi. no more words needed.
Mar 12,5.0,"Not as good as inception but still one of the greatest movies of all time. It is thought provoking, thrilling, masterful, and simply put, brilliant."
Mar 11,5.0,"The most gut wrenching movie of all time: Interstellar I have never cried so much to a single movie. I watched it without knowing my what it was actually about and I now I feel like I know so much but nothing at all. My heart feels empty and heavy after watching this cinematic masterpiece. No amount of awards could amount to how beautiful and psychologically powerful this film is. I don’t think there couldn’t ever be a movie as aspiring and deep as this one. I cried so many times, bawling my eyes out, snot everywhere because my I couldn’t handle the emotions this movie brought me. There so much I want to stay about this movie but nothing amount of words can get my point across of how much this movie changed me and my perspective on life and humanity itself. The idea of time has always been fascinating to me and now I feel so overwhelmed with curiosity over the matter that I don’t know what to do. A movie has never left me in such shambles as this has. I seriously can not stress it enough that it is the greatest film masterpiece of all time and I dearly hope every generation can come to appreciate this movie no matter how the world ends. I don’t know what will happen in the near future of even thousands of years into the future. Maybe life will become what this movie is? Whatever what life may become, I hope that life continues to live, through all the turmoil and the pain, the unknown, the fear, everything. That is life and life continues on even when humanity is gone. I don’t know what else to say, I can’t get my thoughts into words."
Mar 10,4.0,"Interesting plot and storytelling, with consistent tension and development. Acting is great. This all combines to keep the viewer invested in both the story and thr characters. I recommend it if you like Sci-Fi and slowburn tension."
Mar 10,5.0,One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a truly masterpiece.
Mar 9,5.0,"One of my favs...in IMAX, wow, what an experience"
Mar 8,4.5,Lov it
Mar 7,5.0,"Best movie of the past, of the present, and will never be topped."
Mar 7,5.0,WHOOO another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. Such a good movie and I love space so this was a great experience for me.
Mar 7,5.0,"Absolutely breathtaking. This was my first time seeing this movie and I can't believe I missed out on such an excellent movie. The visuals were stunning, the plot was beautifully written, and I don't know a whole lot about physics but I believe Nolan did his research very well."
Mar 7,5.0,"My kids are not watching this movie with me, we would bawl our eyes out - Matthew McConaughey knew exactly how to deliver the most gut-wrenching performance; Beyond the space and sci-fi theme, the film is a profound metaphor for time, the choices we make, and the enduring power of love. Thank you Christopher Nolan & The Interstellar Team"
Mar 6,4.0,"Al principio no le tenía expectativa pero realmente me sorprendió, los efectos y el como se desarrolló la trama fue espectacular."
Mar 4,5.0,"wow this film is very cool and tense, I really like it"
Mar 3,5.0,"My absolute favourite movie. The original Hans Zimmer soundtrack is so emotional and amazing. If you're a movie lover like me, you will adore this movie. It has it's sad moments, a few funny moments. It's just so good. I've watched it quite a few times and I will definitely watch it more."
Mar 3,5.0,"Genuinely one of, if not the best, movies I have ever watched. Nolan never fails"
Mar 2,5.0,A beautiful movie with the perfect amount of everything. Must watch.
Feb 28,5.0,"It was the only movie that made me cry, it was the only movie I watched for the first time and until now the only time it became my favorite movie, Interstellar for me, is a masterpiece that will never be replaced."
Feb 28,5.0,Peak cinema
Feb 26,3.0,"The end bit was a bit silly and deflating. Hard to know what to do with this thing, but it just didn't quite come off in what was otherwise a solid movie."
Feb 24,5.0,Such a great sci-fi film that i have seen in my life and Christopher Nolan finally have change my life
Feb 24,0.5,Bird brain characters and a comedy robot in a serious space movie is a recipe for overpowering feelings of DISDAIN. This guy Chris Nolan has made numerous movies that I can't watch.
Feb 23,1.0,"Preposterous, pseudointellectual, poorly constructed, clichéd, impenetrably masculine, goofy and possessed of an indecipherable ending, Interstellar is the mother of all misfires."
Feb 23,4.0,"Let me get this straight-this movie is a cinematic MASTERPIECE. The story, the music and score, the acting...everything is SO WELL DONE. In my personal opinion Matthew McConaughey completely carried this movie. He delivered such a remarkable and jaw dropping performance that left me speechless at the end. Are we even going to talk about the scene where he watches the videos from his kids?! I was in awe-and honestly a little unsettled-the whole scene because of how real his performance felt, as if he truly was a father mourning the lost years of his kids' lives, like Cooper. The way he could tap into such raw emotion, make himself cry, and deliver such an eerily authentic portrayal was almost frightening in its realism. He also had such a great onscreen bond with Mckenzie Foy that even left me in tears as we watched their relationship and bond unfold and eventually save humanity. There were many aha! Moments and the adrenaline was indeed pumping as I was mesmerized and pulled deeply into concentration on the movie. So why is this movie missing two stars? Don't get me wrong Christopher Nolan completely delivered and made me feel all the emotions he wanted viewers to feel, and while I did enjoy it, it is not a movie to take lightly. There is a lot of informational thrown at you and a lot of words the average movie watcher might not understand. I get it, it's a sci-fi movie, and a great one at that, but the end completely messed with my brain and had me scavaging the internet and Youtube for explanations. Because of this, I feel like this movie is one that you really can't talk to your friends while watching or get up to go to the bathroom since you will miss critical information. Also, there were some scenes and monologues that felt a little too long and didn't do much to drive the story forward. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Interstellar. It's an incredibly captivating and emotional film that kept me hooked from start to finish. While it can be a bit confusing at times and definitely a lot to take in, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves thought-provoking, visually stunning movies."
Feb 23,5.0,"For a sci-fi geek like myself, this is probably nolan's best movie to date (2025), and that's a statement considering his filmography..."
Feb 23,5.0,"This movie is a mind-bending masterpiece. It combines stunning visuals, complex scientific concepts, and deep emotional storytelling. I think people either love it or find it a bit confusing. I needed to watch it twice to understand it. This movie is a must watch and I recommend it to everyone! It also reminds me of a song - Space Song by Beach House."
Feb 22,5.0,So i just discovered this masterpiece is rated less than MAGIC MIKE BY TOMATOERS cristics less than magic mike.... i felt so abused i had to subscribe and tell all this ppl how much ov a joke they are. This is one of a kind. This movie is a masterpiece and you are a joke
Feb 21,5.0,"LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! AMAZING Storyline, graphics and soundtrack!!!!Could watch this over and over again!!!!"
Feb 20,4.0,"Once in a while, there comes along a motion picture that can, to put it bluntly, blow your mind. Consequently, it’s likely to become groundbreaking, setting the gold standard for many movies to come, while having been influenced by classics that came before it, showing some reminiscences or homages to those movies. Years ago, sometime in the early 1980s during my middle school years, I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and found it strange and incomprehensible. But, this was a film directed by Stanley Kubrick. Enough said. I saw the sci-fi classic off and on over the years, and, in time, I grew to understand, appreciate, and like the movie, putting myself in 1968, the film’s year of release, and imagining how revolutionary and mind-blowing the story and visual effects really were back then. Then, on December 11, 2024, for the first time, I saw ""Interstellar,"" Christopher Nolan’s 2014 sci-fi blockbuster, which, beginning December 6, 2024, was having a 10th anniversary re-release in digital and IMAX 70mm formats. The film takes place in a dystopian future when Earth is suffering from a catastrophic blight and famine. With the world’s population at stake, several astronauts are sent by NASA on a space shuttle to travel through a wormhole near Saturn to three planets, which are near a black hole and can sustain human life. After watching the movie, I felt that I had to view it a second time to grasp the complex narrative and convoluted subplots, which I did a week later. Afterwards, I found ""Interstellar"" to be a fantastic and intelligent film. It is also one such motion picture that is, in its own right, breathtaking, innovative, and, perhaps, setting the bar for future films; and, although past sci-fi films have influenced the movie, I thought that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was Interstellar’s biggest influence, especially when it came to the visual effects. I believe that if Kubrick’s sci-fi masterpiece were to be released in 2014 with the visual effects of 10 years ago, or of today for that matter, it would look like ""Interstellar."" Furthermore, you must see Nolan’s sci-fi film in IMAX 70mm to feel and witness the full effect of the visuals. But, to also appreciate ""Interstellar,"" like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" before it, you would have to comprehend, at least, some of the synopsis, subplots, and science behind the protagonists’ goals, as well as grasping the non-linear narrative, which Nolan has used in some of his previous films such as ""Memento,"" ""Dunkirk,"" and the Oscar-winning ""Oppenheimer."" I would love to give you an example, but that would spoil the movie if you haven't seen it. Standout performances go out to Matthew McConaughey as Joesph ""Coop"" Cooper, a former astronaut-turned-farmer who, among other agriculturists and everyone in general, is enduring a worldwide crop blight that is contributing to the extinction of life on Earth; eventually, he is reinstated by NASA to pilot a shuttle on a mission, along with other astronauts, to seek out habitable planets through way of a wormhole. There is also Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, a NASA scientist in charge of planet colonization who is determined to assist Cooper on the shuttle mission. Jessica Chastain is well-casted as Cooper’s daughter Murph, who grows up to become a scientist of NASA after the disappearance of her father 23 years ago and desperately tries to solve a mathematical equation for the building of spacecraft to provide an exodus from Earth. And, the supporting cast of veteran actors Michael Caine as Professor John Brand, the father of Amelia and the director of the shuttle mission, and John Lithgow as Donald, Cooper’s father-in-law, is truly admirable. With a worldwide box office total of now over $740,000,000 since its 2024 re-release, it’s fair to say that many moviegoers have seen ""Interstellar"" overall. And, whether some have loved the film, consider it a mixed bag, or have negative reviews of the movie, Viewers, altogether, may have reaffirmed their viewpoints. A decade can be enough time for filmgoers to reconsider the sci-fi blockbuster, which probably wasn't appreciated during its initial release on November 7, 2014. Perhaps, cinephiles, sci-fi fans, or the mainstream, if it hasn't happened already, will give ""Interstellar"" higher review ratings. I would love to see around an 85%-100% ""fresh"" score on Rotten Tomatoes."
Feb 20,4.5,Very good pacing and storytelling. My only wish is that the son wasn't so cut out of the movie. It felt like Cooper only cared about Murphy which felt a bit strange.
Feb 20,5.0,One of the best sci-fi movies.
Feb 19,5.0,I’ve seen this movie probably 10 times. Simply outstanding. From the acting to the music and the cinematography.
Feb 19,5.0,Great movie. I don’t know where any of the hate is from. It has a great plot and lives you wondering. It has action and more. A must watch.
Feb 18,5.0,"Real hard science Science fiction instead of the usual fluff studios put out as Scifi (for example, the aliens communicating with a post apocalyptic blighted earth -- whom you never see, are said to be five-dimensional beings who communicate through gravity). The vision of this movie is big and the visual effects are even bigger, so see this on a giant home Screen or commercial theatre with big sound too. There's a human story, too, and a father and daughter promise that holds the emotional core of the story together with all the mind-bending science stuff happening. And fun visual rides happen here. Ever wonder what traveling through an actual space wormhole would look like? There are tiny flaws in the characterization in the editing of the final version, but really with a story this ambitious and heroic, who wants to quibble on that front? Finally, the whole family can see this."
Feb 18,5.0,The best sci-fi movie I’ve ever seen! It had me totally captivated!
Feb 18,5.0,ABSOLUTE CINEMA. I still haven't seen a movie better than this.
Feb 17,5.0,"Una película bien loca, con las 5 dimensiones. Y lo importante de estar con la familia. Los efectos especiales son de otro planeta. La recomiendo ver en cine y no en tele, la escena del agujero negro😯."
Feb 16,5.0,"Absolute Cinema, a little sad"
Feb 15,5.0,A real life changing emotional experience that really shows the real meaning of love and what humans are capable of to achieve it the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful it helps set the scene perfectly alongside stunning visuals of space exploration Christopher Nolan absolutely nails it perfectly 10/10
Feb 15,5.0,Way before its time
Feb 15,5.0,"The best science fiction movie in my mind, I always mention this one when I recommend hard science fiction movies to others. The rich knowledge of universe science and the wonderful interpretation of science fiction realism in this movie make me amazed!"
Feb 15,5.0,"One of my favorite movies but the rerelease in imax, wow. A visual and audio masterpiece."
Feb 14,4.0,"A visually stunning, emotional and thoughtful sci fi film by Nolan."
Feb 13,5.0,A cinematic masterpiece.
Feb 13,5.0,Mins blowing breathtaking movie
Feb 13,3.5,"Though a bit too slow at times, the story itself is quite cool, with a most explanatory, though quirky ending. Often too unrealistic, but with optional scientific reasoning which make it entertaining. 7/10 points!"
Feb 13,4.0,"To me this is basically 2001 but good. A scientifically accurate sci-fi movie that still tells a good story with an engaging emotional core. A bit confusing at times, but overall one of Chris Nolan’s most underrated films."
Feb 12,5.0,One of the best movies I've ever seen
Feb 11,2.0,"Perfect example of a director outsmarting himself and boring the audience. A+ for production value and effects. F for writing. The science behind it all is relatively sound, but Nolan gets way too ahead of himself so that while science in movies like Armageddon or The Social Network SOUNDS exciting, the science in this movie drowns you without comprehension. Rather than a twist, theres a twist within a twist within a wormhole. Good luck."
Feb 11,5.0,"A decade later, this still holds up as one of the best SCI-FI and drama movies of all time. The score for this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece, perfectly matching the special effects on screen with the tone of uncertainty and exploration. The underlying themes in this movie, that humans were meant to be pioneers, and that love transcends all, ties together the plot in a way that can bring the most masculine men to tears. A movie that has become tradition to watch yearly, I cannot recommend it enough. A beautiful story of science, fantasy, action, drama, and romance, truly a movie encompassing all genres. Christopher Nolan’s greatest work"
Feb 9,1.0,"Star Trek episode, combine with Space Odyssey 2001 - with a confusing plot, non scientific script. McGonauge was great. Damon and Hathaway looked like they were shoved into a Subway commercial at the last minute."
Feb 9,5.0,Movie of the decade!!!
Feb 9,5.0,I love the movie.Great visual effect and it very heartbreaking movie.It was very great that it is one of the most best space movies I ever watched.
Feb 8,5.0,"It transcends everything. The story, the background score, the CGI , the visuals Everything just keeps you hooked. The expressions of Matthew, the bond between him and little Mackenzie is so heart wrenching . An absolute must watch. It will start making you believe in a higher purpose"
Feb 8,5.0,Loved being able to see this in IMAX twice for the 10th anniversary. This is a stunning perfection of a movie
Feb 6,4.0,"It's definitely not my favorite science fiction movie. Its visuals and cinematography are really great. But the scenario, which was written with logical errors and too many theories, did not appeal to me. There is no physical explanation of the planets they go to. Also, the end of the movie ends with a deus ex machina."
Feb 6,5.0,amazing beautiful perfect great awesome also so sad and so educating and eventful and makes you think about life pls watch this movie at least once in ur life!!!!!
Feb 6,4.5,"Interstellar is an extravagant film that visually captivates with its stunning shots and a story that takes you on an exhilarating journey through the speed of light, immersing you in the profound concepts of time and space. Although the deep space premise might unsettle some viewers, Christopher Nolan masterfully weaves an emotional tapestry with performances from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, which shine like shooting stars, illuminating the narrative. Grading: A"
Feb 3,5.0,"Very good movie definitely recommend if you like space and time travel. I watched this movie around the time I started getting into astronomy. I started reading about the stars in galaxies and I could tell you so much but I’m gonna keep it simple this movie is long, but definitely worth the while. The actors were great and the way it was put together was just brilliant. I definitely recommend."
Feb 2,5.0,Breathtaking on all fronts
Feb 2,4.5,"Great watch, but is very long. 9/10"
Feb 2,4.0,"At almost three hours, it presents an interesting enough story to go by really quick. Although the technology in this movie is decades, if not centuries away, there's just this one part that strays from the boundaries of science that risks spoiling the rest of what's a great story"
Feb 2,3.0,"This film is neither an incredible masterpiece, nor is it complete rubbish. It could have been an incredible masterpiece, delving heavily into explaining in layman‘s terms the idea of time and space and higher quantum physics, but unfortunately, it also wanted to appeal to a really ignorant audience that just wants to see some stars running around perhaps going to be in love or perhaps angry with each other etc. Also, it’s always nice to have a few drama scenes with gizmos and gadgets and funny little robot beings. Stupid people like this. In the end, Nolan didn’t really know which direction he was going in, and I think he shoved in as much physics stuff as he could at the end movie which is what I believe He really wanted to make -which was an intelligent film about the fifth dimension or whatever - so he shoved it all roughly in in the last hour or so of the flic. He then tied it all together with an emotional ending with Matthew McConaughey meeting his old, almost dead daughter. It’s somewhat worth a watch and I would recommend it for anyone trying to have some fun with the elaborate ideas of what we are attempting to strive for as a human species, but I wouldn’t be upset with them if they decided they didn’t want to watch it because you’re not really gonna learn anything New. An admirable Attempt but alas a mediocre one."
Feb 1,5.0,Best movie I’ve seen all year and one of the best movies I’ve seen on the last 15 years. I can’t wait for it to come to IMAX.
Feb 1,5.0,One of the top 20 movies ever made. If like a lot of Science in your Fiction this is for you. Of course if that describes you it’s probable that you have your own gushing review.
Feb 1,2.5,"I was somewhat excited to see this movie given all the great reviews but was somewhat disappointed..First, the movie is too long and drags in parts. Second, there was too much science talk on too many issues to make the plot seem plausible but in the end, I was totally confused and almost didn't care. If the movie maybe limited itself to 2-3 issues with science talk, It would have been better. Less would have definitely been more for the movie Also some of the scenes were ridiculous including Matt Damon and Matthew McConaughey fighting on a foreign planet..Laughable! Acting generally, Ok..Some of the themes were Ok...Overall, not a Bad Movie but definitely an overrated one.."
Jan 31,5.0,"This is just everything you want in a film. Drama, plot, acting and an incredible soundtrack from the great Hans Zimmer. Arguably Nolan’s best film in a great selection. I couldn’t recommend this one highly enough."
Jan 31,2.5,"Una película del montón de la cual a la gente le gusta colgarse para creer ser inteligentes, disfrutable pero fácilmente olvidable"
Jan 31,4.5,Specifically - in IMAX. Worth it. Cinema.
Jan 31,5.0,"A tear felt dream interlaced between the stars, no doubt."
Jan 30,5.0,A movie with a sad story but a special story that if you see it you might never forget it
Jan 30,5.0,One of the best sci-fi movies ever. Great cast and visual effects. The fact that this movie did not win multiple Oscars is an absolute shame.
Jan 30,5.0,My favourite sci-fi movie. Great cinematography and soundtrack.
Jan 30,4.0,"Although I did enjoy the movie, I just felt it never quite reaches your expectations. The whole cast carry it off, the concept has depth but the end doesnt leave you with a wow - still worth a watch and am sure I will watch it again a few times to see what I missed the last time"
Jan 30,5.0,The most profound father/ son bond I have seen in a movie. Great photography and acting with many memorable breathtaking scenes. It gets better and better the more you watch it. As it significantly circulates about the passing of time! This film will definitely stand the test of time.
Jan 29,5.0,"Esta película es una joya. Cada escena, cada encuadre, cada nota de su banda sonora crean una experiencia inolvidable. Es más que cine; es arte puro, una obra hermosa que deja huella en el alma."
Jan 29,5.0,I loved interstellar its my favorite movie
Jan 29,4.0,"Wow! Long, but wow!"
Jan 29,5.0,Beautiful movie. Glad I had the chance to watch it on the big screen.
Jan 29,5.0,best movie i’ve ever watched.
Jan 29,5.0,Wonderful to see such a magnificent film on the screen again. The IMAX improves the experience immensely and is a must-see!
Jan 29,4.5,"Always drawn back to it by it's layers. Entertaining at each viewing, but for an ever-evolving understanding. By the third viewing, I got it. And I found myself weeping at the under-story. It has changed me."
Jan 28,5.0,"Let’s just say that if you haven’t watched it, you’re missing out. BIG time."
Jan 28,5.0,A movie that intrigues you the entire time you’re watching it. There’s a reason this movie is talked about so much it uses actual scientific theory to make a science fiction movie which leads to a movie that doesn’t come off as childish even when it’s making you stretch your imagination and along with this amazing use of science the plot is emotional and heartfelt making you feel for these characters.
Jan 28,4.0,Very good movie all around.
Jan 28,5.0,This masterpiece made me and my friend break out into a passionate orgy in the theatre because we could not control ourselves. That's how good it is.
Jan 27,4.5,My favorite watch of this film.
Jan 26,5.0,"The best movie for me personally , the drama and the emotions provoked by every intense parts makes it incredible,after seeing this movie a few times,Im still thinking that deserved more awards on the Oscars."
Jan 26,5.0,One of the greatest sci-fi films of the decade.
Jan 26,4.0,"i love the movie, I knew that going in, so the movie itself gets a 5 star, but the imax version upscaled the volume a little too much. I felt like I was getting whiplash between the quiet and loud scenes."
Jan 26,5.0,"Great Movie !! If you're an astronomy nerd like me, you're bound to like this movie; - Story : 10/10; - Theme/Music : 10/10; this movie is juste beautiful."
Jan 25,5.0,The ideal format for this amazing film. So glad it returned to IMAX.
Jan 25,5.0,"I first watched this film when it was released and didn't pay attention to anything other than it's long running time. What a selfish fool I was! Watching it again ten years later after all of my life's experience, it is an utter masterpiece! The music, the artistry, the out of this earth visions. Incredible"
Jan 25,5.0,"I missed it at the movies the first time around. IMAX experience came up, and my daughter and I jumped on it. We were mesmerized. An enlightening experience."
Jan 24,4.5,Epic the soundtrack the storyline epic
Jan 24,5.0,I've never watched the movie like that. It's the top of cinematography (in my opinion).
Jan 24,4.5,"Definitivamente una obra maestra; la música sonora, la fotografía, la historia... Todo es bueno."
Jan 23,5.0,It’s Interstellar. Enough said lol
Jan 22,3.5,Wow. Visually this movie was great. Kept you on the edge of the seat and personally kept me in engaged into the story. Not much of a Sci-Fi guy but this was good. I needed the ending explained to me like a 5 year old but that's OK. Giving this a 3.5 out of 5. Good movie.
Jan 22,5.0,"I love this movie so much! Even though the graphics are a bit outdated at times, the sheer impact of the plot of this movie is amazing! And such great acting from all the characters."
Jan 21,5.0,"Another wonderful Christopher Nolan film with an exceptionally talented cast. I dont want to spoil anything so just watch it, you wont be disappointed."
01/20/2025,5.0,My favorite part of the movie was how the concept of time and gravity across dimensions and reality was explored.
01/20/2025,5.0,Great movie of all time
01/20/2025,5.0,Great movie. The SFX are outstanding.
01/19/2025,5.0,the Real deserved Of The Oscar 2015
01/19/2025,4.0,So fun to see it in theatres again! Just not sure the theatre is any different from the regular ones.
01/19/2025,5.0,"Great film. However, this was the smallest IMAX screen I have ever been to."
01/19/2025,5.0,Top 5 movie of all time
01/19/2025,5.0,Fantastic film. Even better score. IMAX is the way to experience this movie! One of my favorite nolan films as well.
01/18/2025,5.0,"It was a phenomenal experience to finally be able to watch this on an IMAX screen! The acoustics alone had the ability to make you dissolve and experience the movie as though you were apart of it, not simply watching!"
01/18/2025,5.0,What a great movie to see in IMAX! Excellent story line. The soundtrack rumbled the theater. The film has a excellent cinematography.
01/17/2025,4.0,"Seldom do I enjoy watching a science fiction movie, but this peace blew me away. Not only is the storyline catchy, but also the special effects are outstanding, and all the actors did a remarkable job, because it was able to get me fully immersed into a three hours long sci-fi film. Recommend 100%."
01/17/2025,3.5,"One of those films that ages very well. Magnificent sound, VFX and a beautiful score."
01/17/2025,5.0,"I love this movie! Even if your not into science fiction this is definitely a movie that everyone should see at some point. This movie does a great job at making you think outside the box at what could really be out there. Casting was great, cgi was outstanding, but one of my favorite moments in the movie is when they first get to space and it goes completely silent, AMAZING!"
01/16/2025,5.0,"Me parece increíble que para el tiempo que dura jamás se me hizo larga, todo tiene un fin, todo termina cuadrando, no le sobra nada."
01/15/2025,5.0,"Love this movie but, too long. and this movie make me tired. but still good cinema. love you nolan"
01/15/2025,3.0,"Beautiful visuals, good acting and a fascinating story, however the script feels heavy handed at times."
01/14/2025,5.0,Every thing about this film is perfect. The Acting. The Score. Everything. Nolan is truly a master of the film and this film is the best demonstration of that. 10/10 without a doubt.
01/14/2025,5.0,Wonderful. Both in acting and in the overall story. This movie hit a special place in my heart that no other science fiction movie could achieve.
01/13/2025,3.5,"Interstellar is another technical wonder by Nolan which is flawless in cinematography, character development, world building and performances. However, the thing that holds it back is its intellectual quotient which makes it come across as confusing rather than intelligent."
01/13/2025,4.5,"Esse filme é espetacular, principalmente no cinema. Esse filme é um filmaço"
01/13/2025,5.0,I had to take two stabs at this movie to truly understand the magnificence of the theme. Absolutely loved it. Murph and Coops love which transcends time and space is truly moving. Loved it
01/13/2025,5.0,the best movie ever by far
01/13/2025,1.5,"This could have been a majestic film save for Matthew McC. Continually giving the ""Im a hard man, and every woman drools over me"" as Cooper. What dreadful casting. But its personal opinion and what do I know?"
01/12/2025,5.0,"Easily the best cinematic experience I've ever had in my life, although in my favorite film, the feeling that is brought through the direction, art, script, acting and most importantly, THE MUSIC, simply the best and most striking soundtrack ever made in the cinema, an incredible experience at home but necessary at the cinema."
01/12/2025,5.0,The best movie I have ever seen. Nothing more needs to be said.
01/12/2025,5.0,One of my favorite original scores and films of all time this was my first time enjoying it on the big screen. A film full of thought and wonder.
01/11/2025,3.0,"After many times, and the second time since I understand it, I now can say that I don’t buy it. The quantics resource it’s used too much, and the script it gets to a point that everyone is saying things that nobody understands and it’s sounds gibberish, so no Mr. Nolan this I don’t like."
01/11/2025,5.0,"This movie for me is pretty much perfection, the cinematography, the writing and the acting all out together brilliantly. This could possibly be for me the greatest movie of all time!! DO NOT SKIP 10/10"
01/11/2025,4.5,"Buena pelicula. Banda sonora espectacular, el hecho que te tome tiempo en contar la historia y establecer relación entre personajes la hace especial. El tema audiovisual es sublime, pelicula recomendada, al inicio pensarás que demora mucho pero al final aplaudirás de la excitación."
01/10/2025,5.0,"I'm 15 years old now and watched the movie for the first time when I was 12. Since then I have seen the movie probably about 13 times, and feel what most captivated me the most about this movie was the yes, the visuals and acting, but what captured me the most was the music. The music in the movie is absolutely remarkable and I want to thank Hans Zimmer for making me want to learn to play the main theme and to learn how to play the piano in the first place. Recently I played it for my school talent show and received a standing ovation. Thank Hans Zimmer and thank you Christopher Nolen."
01/10/2025,5.0,Amazing seeing it in IMAX again. This is the movie IMAX was made for.
01/10/2025,5.0,Do not go gentle into that good night...
01/10/2025,5.0,"Absolutely, unequivocally, the most beautiful, mind altering, sensational film I have ever watched. This is the only movie in history I have ever given a 10/10 (5/5 here). This film is absolutely worth the watch, especially if you have any interest in theoretical space/time/exploration. I had been told for years to watch this film, never listened, but I couldn’t be more grateful that I did before it hit netflix. In fact, I made my account soulfully to leave this review. Please, if you see this, do yourself a favor and watch this film."
01/09/2025,5.0,Stunning and beautiful.
01/08/2025,5.0,Created an account to post a review on this movie. It is mind bending and thought-provoking. The emotions this movie makes you feel are so deep and real. This movie is an all time great. An instant classic.
01/08/2025,4.5,Wow! Glad I stayed second time around (fell asleep first time )!
01/07/2025,5.0,"Expertly written, designed and executed."
01/07/2025,0.5,Mediocre at most. I’m not sure how you got to 87% but yah skip it
01/06/2025,5.0,Amazingly rich and deeply thought provoking film. Superb acting and visuals that will take you out of this world!
01/06/2025,5.0,Interstellar is the best of all time. No question
01/06/2025,5.0,"While ""Interstellar"" undeniably presents a sophisticated, science-fiction adventure, it stands apart by rooting its story in a believable family drama. Director Christopher Nolan gets the very best out of his cast and crew to transport audiences into both a dystopian future and the far-reaching corners of outer space. Overall, the film is a cinematic experience that is both satisfying to watch and intriguing to contemplate."
01/06/2025,5.0,"Truthfully I had always heard about Interstellar. I always knew the hype that surrounded it, but to believe that 2014 film would be one of the greatest ever, would've been hard for me to swallow. I love new films, but I've always known and believed that oldies are where it's at, or was, and that nothing will ever come close. But I can say now, after watching this movie, I understand what THEY (pun intended) were talking about. I love movies, and I've watched so very many, but I promise you, this one is touching. It'll make you laugh, and it it'll definitely make you cry. This is peak cinema, and I know I'm just another review to you, and I am not currently a top critic, but I promise you, this is one of the greatest films you'll ever see, at least it was for me."
01/06/2025,5.0,"gorgeous, spectacular, epic"
01/06/2025,5.0,"This movie is perfection! The score, the visuals, the story, the acting are all top notch. This movie will definitely move you and hit you right in the feels."
01/06/2025,5.0,"That movie was crazy! Some parts of the movie are a bit confusing for people but somehow I wasn’t confused. This is in my top five movies of all time. I also love the visuals and story of this movie. I don’t care if you have a short attention span, you need to see this."
01/05/2025,1.0,"Awful film. The good parts are good space visuals and an interesting subtheme that explores the idea of time relativity. The rest of the film is overblown and disjointed. All of the performers were good but the story and pacing felt strained the whole movie. Character motivations were routinely skipped over, actions seemed to come out of nowhere. I read another review that summed it up nicely, great ideas don't translate into great movies. Skip it."
01/05/2025,5.0,"i am blown away and overtaken. i’ve heard of, but never seen, this film before & boy am i glad i tuned in. though its a lengthy watch, it didn’t feel like it. i felt fully immersed in their world, their timeline. i found the science and physics of it all fascinating, and to balance it out with the emotional stories & moments.. i sobbed several times. what an outstanding film."
01/05/2025,0.5,"Weak dialogue, mostly clique speak."
01/05/2025,4.5,Sequel might be nice.
01/05/2025,5.0,"Visually stunning, cinematography is excellent, emotionally gut wrenching. An adventure that leaves disbelief suspended (for the most part) and your heart invested (for the most part) in this beautifully shot, beautifully art directed and very well told (for the most part) masterpiece. Connecting a real life existential and relatable human condition with an epic sci fi. One of my top 5."
01/05/2025,4.5,"L'un de mes films préféré de science-fiction, avec un casting particulièrement intéressant. La dernière demi étoile que je n'attribue pas pour ce film vient de son côté trop américanisé et rocambolesque par moment qui nous sort du film."
01/05/2025,5.0,"One of the best movies of the 2010s, a must see masterpiece. Zimmer does an amazing job with the score that really draws the audience in."
01/04/2025,5.0,"Wow. Some of McConaughey's acting in the beginning is a little goofy, and I'm not the biggest Anne Hathaway fan, but who cares. This is a magnificent epic of a movie and what a sci fi movie should be. Incredible detail and it all works at least to a non-scientist like myself. Man, Nolan outdid himself with this one. I love how there's no antagonist until two thirds through the movie."
01/03/2025,5.0,"Cinema at its finest. Interstellar is visually breathtaking, it delivers a beautifully laid out, well connected story. It highlights strong themes, the acting from McConaughey is perfect, and the film overall takes you on an emotional, resonant, thought-provoking journey that you enjoy every second of."
01/03/2025,5.0,An amazing journey through space & time. A real mind bender that you can't get out of your head!
01/03/2025,4.5,"It’s really good but just short of great. I respect what it tried to do but ultimately it was too long and tried a bit too hard. Even with its shortcomings it was still pretty damn good and worth a watch, especially if seen in IMax."
01/03/2025,3.0,"I think you have to approach this film as a space fantasy rather than as science fiction. It is simply far beyond suspension of disbelief, not least when the NASA board room rolls back a single flimsy wall to reveal its interstellar rocket. The ""ghost"" behind the bookshelf is clever, yet somehow in the end disappointing as a plot device. A tremendous feat of effects and cinematography, but I personally need a bit more believability."
01/02/2025,0.5,"This movie had so much potential…. But it didn’t reach it. My husband and I had tears in our eyes during one part, but the rest of the movie was confusing, and it didn’t need to be. I was stuck between “am I dumb, and just not understanding the science talk” or “is this a bad movie”. Came to the conclusion that it is just a bad movie."
01/02/2025,5.0,I watch this once a year - that should tell you of my opinion on this film.
01/02/2025,5.0,"Nolan’s ""Interstellar"" is a sadly amazing film that blends stunning visuals with an emotional storyline. The breathtaking cinematography and powerful performances make it unforgettable, but its themes of love and loss leave a bittersweet feeling."
01/02/2025,3.5,I thought it was a great movie but the ending (SPOILER ALERT) was a little confusing .... Did Cooper make it home? Where was Brand??
01/02/2025,5.0,One of the best movies of the 21st Century
01/01/2025,4.5,My favorite Nolan film that I’ve seen.
12/31/2024,5.0,watching Interstellar in 70mm IMAX is honestly life changing.
12/31/2024,5.0,Top 10 Best.....absolutely. A must-see movie that will open & bend your mind.
12/31/2024,5.0,Best Movie ever. A Masterpiece.
12/30/2024,5.0,From start to finish impeccable. How people still haven't seen this movie is beyond me. An absolute beauty
12/29/2024,1.0,Complete load of garbage sorry
12/28/2024,0.5,I don't understand what the characters are saying or what is going on the only thing I like was the visuals and cinematography
12/28/2024,5.0,Best movie I’ve ever seen.
12/28/2024,5.0,"First time watching it, I get it now..."
12/28/2024,5.0,It was the best movie I have ever seen because of the Galaxy of all the universes our universes other universes is going by other timelines. It's not just our dimension it's other dimensions too. we are all here to make everything better not relax and be selfish. We are the people who will make everything better so that's why we all matter and that's why we're here to make everything better.
12/28/2024,5.0,"Stunning, a space epic"
12/28/2024,5.0,"Experiencing Christopher Nolans Interstellar on a huge screen, combined with feeling the music/sounds and bass in your seat made for an unforgettable experience, especially with a movie that has such an amazing soundtrack."
12/28/2024,5.0,"Jaw dropping, beautiful, gets better with every viewing"
12/27/2024,5.0,Insane. I'm speechless for all the good reasons after watching it.
12/27/2024,5.0,Best movie of all time.
12/27/2024,5.0,Just re-saw it at the cinema after 10 years and I was glued to my seat. I had forgotten what a masterpiece this movie it.
12/26/2024,5.0,One of Nolan’s best. The best movie I have ever seen.
12/26/2024,5.0,I love this movie! Has an interesting plot and keeps my interest.
12/26/2024,0.5,"What a load of old rubbish. Just another tired remake 2001. Hollywood fails to understand (yet again) that just sticking a movie star in a space helmet does not make entertainment. I suggest this movie be renamed Incoherent. In this space movie, everyone will hear you scream."
12/25/2024,3.5,8.1/10 я суть не понял но как снято
12/25/2024,5.0,Phenomenal movie! A must see for any emotional sci-fi fan💕
12/24/2024,4.5,The most visually stunning movie I have ever seen! Christopher Nolan has proven himself to be one of the best directors of all time!
12/24/2024,5.0,"Magical experience, it felt like I watched it for the first time again. 70mm film was legitimately a life-changing experience."
12/23/2024,5.0,A movie for dreamers
12/23/2024,5.0,"IMO top 2 movie all-time for Chris Nolan. The other is Inception which is #1. Everything else follows and I've seen all of them. Yes Oppenheimer won an Oscar but let's be real it doesn't hold a candle to Inception or Interstellar, which is Nolan's bread and butter, sci-fi and action."
12/23/2024,5.0,"Everytime i see this movie i understand something new like every time..... the murphy's law, the upper dimension beings, the wormhole and everything was mind bogling. like the connection of the starting to the end. This movie is a ""CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE""."
12/22/2024,5.0,"One of the greatest movies I have ever watched , it truly tugged on my heart strings , from the music, to the bonds formed with the characters throughout the film , and the over all story line . The originality of the film played a massive part in my opinion , the complex links in the story truly grasped my overall love for the film. A truly amazing, emotional, and overall impeccable movie!!!"
12/21/2024,5.0,I have seen this movie about 12 times but never in theaters. I was blown away. It was just as jaw dropping as the first time I saw it. Truly a timeless film.
12/21/2024,5.0,"Excellent must see for all sci fi fans. Great story, acting and concepts."
12/21/2024,5.0,Like all of Nolans movies (yes including Tenet) The movie is amazing!! Leaves me in tears at the end EVERY SINGLE TIME. The only gripe I have has nothing to do with the movie but with the theater. 10:15 start time. Movie starts at 10:40 after previews and what not.
12/21/2024,5.0,70 mm IMAX - the way Nolan intended.
12/21/2024,5.0,A must see in imax..
12/21/2024,5.0,"Nolan's, and one of the 21st Century's best. See it on the biggest screen possible. So rarely do you see any work or art so successfully address the biggest questions of our Moment, and of our species, so successfully. This is an outstanding monument to the power of Cinema."
12/21/2024,5.0,one of the all time nest movies
12/20/2024,5.0,"This movie is well loved for good reason. This was my first time seeing it in theater as I didn't have much interest when it first came out, but I'd watched it multiple times at home. Amazing emotional experience and great story. Leaves you wondering and in thought!"
12/20/2024,5.0,Best sci-fi movie ever.
12/20/2024,5.0,Simply the Best! And even better in IMAX!
12/20/2024,5.0,"As always this movie leaves me with a profound appreciation for cinema. Getting to see it in IMAX again took me back a decade to when I was a teenager. This movie deserves the experience an IMAX screen offers. To this day this masterpiece achieves what many movies could only dream of achieving. Not only is it visually and sonically exceptional, Its story still is as impactful as it was the first time I saw it. I will be thinking of this experience until I can see it in IMAX again."
12/20/2024,5.0,Great flick. Incredible venue - sound was pretty incredible.
12/20/2024,5.0,"I’ve watched this movie like a hundred times, need I say more?"
12/20/2024,5.0,"I’d pay you to go see it, that’s how great it was"
12/20/2024,5.0,"A spectacular and riveting film that is thought provoking, filled with heart. My personal all time favorite movie and theater experience.

12/20/2024,5.0,"On the biggest screen around it’s a film that’s marvelous. A movie about intergalactic space travel with humanity’s survival on the line, epic scenery, intense action and drama, gets a lot more immersive and grand. The way films like this have to be seen."
12/20/2024,5.0,My favorite movie viewed in the best way possible.
12/20/2024,1.0,"Fandango cancelled my ticket and then changed the showtime by 15 minutes, rather than just move my ticket to the second showtime. I've seen Interstellar countless times at this point, and twice in IMAX 70mm since 2014. This isn't a knock on the film, it's the greatest space film ever made and one of my personal favorites. But Fandango pulled a Ticketmaster. Therefore, 1 star."

12/19/2024,5.0,"I just rewatched this movie in an imax rerelease for what must be the 8th time watching it. From its plot, to cgi and acting this movie is one of the best I’ve seen. It says something when a movie means more the second time you watch it. I’ll never understand any criticism on this movie but to each his own. Thank you to Christopher Nolan for carrying the movie industry on his back with movies that are just as enjoyable to rewatch."
