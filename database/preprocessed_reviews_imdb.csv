2021.10.29,10,sometimes i just need to see the start. or end. or a trailer. or the music and theme from hans zimmer. or the whole movie. just to feel that thing i only get from this movie. that the earth space and time are something special mystical. i never forget the first time i saw this movie in an imax theatre in 2014. i was struck by it. totally got me. and it stil does 7 years later. this is the best movie ever made for me. because of the feeling it gives me no other movie can. so hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. brilliant.,15
2019.06.26,10,after watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 i swore to god i will wait 5 years to watch it again so i get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again this without doubt is the best movie ever made,1
2015.05.31,10,a lot has been said and written about interstellar. you can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. youll either love this one or you wont. i kind of would have loved to have watched this on an imax screen the sheer scope of the whole thing. its just amazing what nolan has put on screen here. its not only the visual experience there is no 3d here by the way its the storyride you take with it. it might be clear to some earlier than to others where its heading no pun intended but it doesnt change the fact that its beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time. going out and saying this will be considered a classic might not be too far stretched but you still can never predict those things. the deserved love the movie gets on imdb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. the acting is really good but i can understand if some people have issues with the ending. but the movie had to end in one way or another. its the best possible way this could go even if its not in our grasps just yet ...,13
2022.05.08,10,amongst the best movies of all time. the story the acting the script the cinematography the effects the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 1010s. but what beats all of that is hans zimmers compositions. how he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing.,4
2016.04.13,10,interstellar is a movie like no other. unlike many apocalyptic scifi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction ala the terminator movies it instead asserts that technology will save us. not everyone in interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. thoughtful intelligent young characters share this sentiment. this belief gained steam following a worldwide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earthcrops and humans. farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. cooper mcconaughey remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. he feels like a man lost in time until he stumbles into the headquarters of nasa which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval. here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. we need technology to save us. as michael caine playing the brilliant duh! professor brand eloquently tells cooper we were never meant to save the world. we were meant to leave it. for a movie that won an oscar for best visual effects and deservedly so the sound stole the show. hans zimmer dark knight trilogy unleashed a performance that was quite appropriately out of this world. never have i seen a movie elevated so much by its score. the sound literally took my breath away. forgive me for the next paragraph. i will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movies sound. skip it if you please. you have your warning. the music fueled every important scene. in every meaningful moment zimmers harmonies captivated watchers attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. the music elucidated those emotional scenes particularly ones featuring cooper and his daughter in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. i sat frozen jaw agape with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. the sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body flowing to my appendages supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. the music was truly the life force of movie. yes we all witnessed a visual triumph a daring creative wonder the likes of which we havent encountered since inception. yes nearly every actors performance proved worthy of commendation. mcconaughey is on fire. chastain is blossoming into a star. at this point michael cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as albert einstein people would wonder if the role were beneath him. all this considered and the sound still towered over everything. i walked out of the theater believing that i had experienced something unique something truly special. interstellar inspires it awes and above all it entertains. i cannot ask for more than that.,37
2015.04.08,10,this movie was the best written acted visual effected etc. movie. this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. i am a huge christopher nolan fan and this movie was his finest. matthew mcconaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. anne hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in les miserables i have no idea how she didnt get an oscar for this. the visual effects were more than just oscar worthy. they were pioneering. i have never seen anything like it. one thing i would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. not like einstein stuff though. i would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a nolan fan or not. i give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.,13
2025.01.02,10,i think of movies as an art form that evokes emotions in us homo sapiens. interstellar is one of those rare pieces of art that stirs the deepest unexplainable feelings about what it means to be aliveaware of our temporary existence yet capable of imagining beyond time into the infinite. its exploration of love sacrifice and the unknown feels profoundly human connecting us to something greater. the visuals are breathtaking the score is hauntingly beautiful and the story resonates on an emotional and philosophical level. this movie made me cry not just for its sadness but for its sheer overwhelming beauty.,5
2015.04.06,10,i judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize i need the bathroom how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. well i watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. my interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. being old enough and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 a space odyssey  and viewed it several times since  of course i made comparisons and there were a few but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. im not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye well youre a critic youre not enjoying the movie because youre too busy looking for bloopers and faults. were there bloopers and faults? the darn movie was so riveting if there were any i didnt notice them!,7
2022.06.25,10,a sciencefiction masterpiece. nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. add to that great performances from nolan and hathaway plus a great score from hans zimmer. the result is on the best sciencefiction movies of all time.,4
2014.10.29,6,i will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything. right off i should say i love nolan. i adore most of his movies and interstellar is no exception. it is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. his shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with interstellar. this could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the fatherdaughter relationship he creates. nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. i have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. again the visuals are completely off the charts. the visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that nolan has always excelled at. given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years gravity recently came out interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of visual effects.he will most likely win visual effects at the oscars. the hanss score is marvelous and will most likely earn an oscar nomination. matthew mcconaugheys acting is good but nothing stellar especially coming off the best acting role of his career. he plays the character like it should be played but nolans characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.the same can be said for the rest of the cast. the little girl was marvelous though. i do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever but i have to say it is one of the most original scripts ive ever seen.  ultimately this movie is entertaining. there is no way nolan can miss that. another great thing that nolan excels at is inspiring. by the time the credits rolled and people walked out i sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. personally i dont think this is nolans best. i believe memento stands as his masterpiece. but with nolan everyone has their own favorite movie. maybe for some interstellar will be their favorite movie for it is really nolans most ambitious and visuallystriking work.  by the way anyone else who even tries to compare interstellar to 2001 a space odyssey is out of their mind. kubricks mission was to create art. nolan in interstellar sets to awe and inspire its audiences. it is truly a great piece of work.,31
2019.04.17,10,all is amazing. i cant describe anything. its a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. i am a real seriesmovies lover and... this was awesome.,5
2014.11.07,7,not many directors have the clout of christopher nolan. most of them receive notes from their fretting studios suggestions or demands to change plot points or highlight certain charactersactors which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. with huge intelligent blockbuster successes like the dark knight franchise and inception nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from warner bros. for interstellar  he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. in effect hes making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. ironically this lack of oversight might be just what keeps interstellar  a very good occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond  from greatness. cooper matthew mcconaughey a former pilot and engineer is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving earth. with sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day it doesnt seem likely that coopers children stoic tom and inquisitive murphy will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. while investigating a ghost in murphys bedroom cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a topsecret nasa base. once there cooper learns from his former mentor dr brand michael caine that nasa is looking for solutions to earths crisis in other galaxies. a recentlyopened wormhole has given nasa and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. brand appeals to cooper to pilot the final and most important mission to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. but its a journey from which cooper might never return  one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved. thats not even the half of it  nolans narrative is a sprawling ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. its shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist kip thorne who served as a consultant on the film. indeed much of interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one cant help wondering if its simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters. clocking in at almost three hours interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. the science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit with nolan crafting some chillingly smart scifi moments amidst the human drama experienced by coopers crew. as badly as cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home amelia brand anne hathaway has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet thats furthest away from the wormhole. they trade hope for time the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. the film is at its best when the members of the endurance  including david gyasis romilly and wes bentleys doyle  confront one another and establish contact or fail to do so with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole. but interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. the science of it may be wellfounded who knows after all what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole? and the concept very cool but it doesnt quite translate as such. instead the film hyperblasts itself into a oddly cheerful and confusing ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. theres no denying either that nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. instead many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion including a moment when cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. its pretty evident too that nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film for no other discernible reason his camera lingers in extreme closeup  and far too often  on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film. nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well and it shows. mcconaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career mcconnaissance and hes ably supported by a steely hathaway whose character just like the film shes in blends cold pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. jessica chastain and matt damon in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers are excellent too  the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect. for months before its release nolan kept interstellar firmly under wraps. everyone speculated that it would be a gamechanger  a sci fi blockbuster as thrilling and thoughtprovoking as it is entertaining. in some ways thats true of the final product nolans film is brave brainy filmmaking and it looks absolutely spectacular. but on closer examination interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish  and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.,35
2014.11.11,5,so did i get this right? the essence of timespace relativity is that youre able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase and shout in vain that you shouldnt do what youre about to do?  yes thats how silly this movie is. interstellar is supposed to be a film exploring einsteins relativity theory. it shows how space travelers enter a wormhole to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind which is suffering from heat drought and hunger on planet earth. by doing so they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. the problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else.  take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? i would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or ipad would be much more convenient. in that respect her was much more realistic.  i could go on. how about a top scientist saying things like only love transcends time and space so why dont we put our trust in that? or how about handing the command of the space ship thats supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? and how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet?  apart from this there are several other things about this film i didnt like. the overthetop soundtrack filled with some sort of church organ music. the artificial dialogues mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. the numerous melodramatic and tearjerking scenes. the subtle message that love is superior to science. the countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling as if it were a boeing flying through a patch of turbulence.  i had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like christopher nolan could appeal to non scifi fans like me. but i was disappointed.,23
2015.12.14,10,interstellar  review certain things in life are precious. very precious. and so was the film for me. why you might ask? well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. in a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the imax on a cold november night with 2 tickets to interstellar. my only knowledge was that nolan directed it and mcconaughey stars in it. the images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by hans zimmer and his music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. and there it was.. the ending. i couldnt believe it . i was reliving rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment the smell of popcorn my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes.  ..  . well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. maybe i should start watching trailers again .,16
2018.06.24,10,i hadnt seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the dr.  one of my favorite movies of all time. i would give the first half of the movie an 1110 just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi thrillerin the sense of so much always being on the line. i loved the acting and just yeah a great movie and one you should go see if you never have,4
2014.11.05,10,i have been a cinema lover for years read a lot of reviews on imdb and everywhere and never found the right movie to write my first review. i always thought i would wait for the movie. and this is it! when i first heard that nolan was preparing a scifi movie i felt like a kid again waiting for his christmas gift under the tree. i knew it would become a classic. and im sure it will. first of all it is incredibly beautiful to watch. honestly it was so beautiful that i felt like i was sucked into the movie. the way nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 a space odyssey actually many things will probably remind you of this movie. we can feel the talent of christopher nolan just by looking at the way it is filmed. the techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. the sound environment is just mesmerizing. it is a very important part of the movie because some scenes take place in space and noland just found the right way to use sound. the soundtrack made by the great hans zimmer is breathtaking epic amazing unreal. i could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.  these two important parts image and sound create a stunning atmosphere. you will forget you are in a movie theater and you will be lost in space sucked into the adventures of this new space odyssey begging for more. it is a truly unique experience. i can say that i have never felt something like that in a movie theater at least not for the past ten years. then of course the cast. first of all matthew mcconaughey. i discovered this actor in tropic thunder but he didnt really convince me though he was quite funny. then i saw dallas buyers club. since that movie i love him. in this movie... well he is the movie. i exaggerate a bit since there are other great actors some even unexpected with a special guest who play extremely well. but he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story which is very important in interstellar. he is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story as a father as a human. anne hathaway was very convincing all together the actors managed to create some harmony which makes the human interactions credible. caine chastaing and affleck are a perfect choice. and then there is... the special guest i will call him x. his role which could be seen as a minor role is actually much more important than that. he proves once again that he is a great actor. watch and see. and finally the scenariostory. i wont spoil anything here ill just try to convince you how great it is. nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. well once again he did it. with the dark knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. with interstellar hes revolutionizing the scifi genre in cinema. from what i heard he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with that movie. and we can feel and see it. during the fifties asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. lucas and kubrick did the same in cinema. today nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done brace yourselves my friends we have not seen anything yet.  why? well simply because we only know a few things about space some things cant be proved for the moment so we can use theory and make the best of it. that is exactly what nolan did. he used theories that exist today and made a movie about mankind about pioneers about humanity about us. because in spite of all the scifi aspect it is a story about humanity. mcconaughey hathaway and mainly x will managed to convince you about that. my rating for this movie can only be a 10 because in itself it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. it is a classic. those who say we cant compare this movie to 2001 space odyssey nor can we compare nolan to kubrick are wrong. we can and we should. talented people dont live only in the past some genius live today among us. and nolan is one of them. many say that he is overrated. i truly dont think so. only time will answer that. this is the scifi movie of the decade and probably the best movie nolan ever made. just go for it without a second thought.,64
2020.08.28,10,there is not even a single day i dont think of this movie its scenes  it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever.,1
2016.01.27,9,set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot joseph cooper is now a farmer growing corn. his daughter murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room cooper doesnt believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. he goes to that location and finds himself at a nasa base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near saturn. he is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. the plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a backup plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole this means that as hours pass for cooper years are passing back on earth. this film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the earth before getting the mission to save the world started this means the separation of cooper and murphey is more emotional. once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. the small cast does a fine job especially matthew mcconaughey who plays cooper anne hathaway who plays amelia brand a scientist aboard the mission and mackenzie foy and jessica chastain who play the younger and older murphey. the effects looked great as one would expect in a film from christopher nolan and i was pleased that space was depicted as silent something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration. overall id recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of 2001  a space odyssey although this has more emotion to it than that classic.,12
2019.10.06,10,this is a mankind achievement. the best movie ever made. is anyone has doubt?,3
2015.05.20,6,you would think the story is adventurous exciting beautiful! its not at all what i had hoped. it is slow dark as a black hole loud as an old barton theater organ playing fugue in d minor interesting as a litter box.  the story is thin.....i cant blame the actors the entire plot is pretty simple. cant inhabit earth find somewhere else to live. interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before i wont spoil it but its all been told before.  dialog is dreary slow ponderous. the comparison to 2001 is preposterous. the wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. this is not at all pioneering inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all.  the imagery is not all that unique or impressive. the constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. most of the show i was trying to nod off but for the loud theater organ playing in the background i probably would have.  i have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells clean power they are still burning fossil fuels. the robots are lego like silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous.  i would not call this horrible or awful i have seen some real stinkers over the years. interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be.,22
2014.11.01,10,the film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions men overexploited land resources which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. this life is not enough for cooper brilliantly played by mcconaughey who gave body and soul to this character. but all of this wouldnt hold without the total control of christopher nolan based on the languishing soundtrack by hans zimmer the luminous and impenetrable photography of hoyte van hoytema and the sincerity of nolans directing. he manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time always in harmony with hans zimmers soundtrack to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. thus we are transported into the same cockpit that cooper we feel the same remorse that he can already feel we feel the same gravity and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. all of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film to directly jump from when cooper leaves in his truck leaving his family behind him to endurance taking off. this simple editing decision allows nolan to give an original movement to his film and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film. you dont necessarily have to understand it immediately  the film will raise questions in you such as  what is it to be a human being is there some physical limitations to our humanity how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge is there other dimensions that we can not access to and above all what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? is this bond only intelligible or is it also tangible ? all these questions resonate in harmony in nolans interstellar.  interstellar is itself a crescendo increasing sensitivity and creativity. i use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by hans zimmer which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a scifi movie. we are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement a total symbiosis a bit like the music of gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. zimmers crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene whether it is in visually powerful  intense moments or in more intimate moments it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations and manages to extend them sometimes almost to choking before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spellbounded.  i have seen all the talent of the director that i knew he was outside the norm but whom i did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. because this is it interstellar is not an action movie not really a blockbuster and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. its much more than that. this is much more than just a scifi movie. it is unlike any of his previous films. some hoped to see interstellar as christopher nolans best film and they were disappointed that this was not the case. and indeed this is not the best film of christopher nolan. because in a way it is his first film. im not saying that interstellar is not as good as his other films it goes beyond all of them. but to me interstellar is the first film of a new stage in nolans filmography  it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. interstellar is the proof that nolan has finally managed despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of the dark knight to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work original humble sincere and deeply meticulously measured. now in this third act of the film it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. but he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. but nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. from my point of view only solaris by steven soderbergh 2002 unfortunately neglected by the audience was able to accomplish that. interstellar is based on a premise which is the following  from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species as we always leave a part of ourselves behind us. in other words i could say that this is a human story and even if we go as far as we want to if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of we will only get closer to them. because the separation and thus the distance and time can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. because it is going to the end of the world when we reach the end of ourselves that we reach the singularity of the black hole beyond the horizon   it is our humanity. no i wasnt been able to find any bad flaws in the film. not one and im still looking. after all interstellar is like gravity all it takes is a little push !  youll have to see the movie to figure that one out. flix tardieu november 1st 2014,39
2014.11.13,6,though i am not a batperson and do not wish to become one i have admired christopher nolan for his early films and inception though with the exception of insomnia i always regarded them as in the immortal words of andrew sarris less than meets the eye. i do not like to call films pretentious but with memento and inception the word certainly came to mind. they seemed shallow pretending to be deep. the same is in my opinion certainly true of interstellar. yes it carries you along for a ride and yes the special effects are great and yes it might give us pause to think what will in fact be the destiny of our species. but my dear mr nolan surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting american flags on distant planets. and like gravity before it the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. the image of cooper floating around saturn without his spaceship waiting to be picked up by a passing probe just before his oxygen runs out of course is so ridiculous that if stanley kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the starchild at the end of 2001 hed punch you in the nose.  interstellar  for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever i do not use that word in a derogatory sense visual representation of multidimensional string theory towards the end is void of any real cultural insight. the film simply extends the wizard of oz into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. it is tosh! great films tell us something memorable about the human condition or the nature of cinema itself. this film for all its quotes from dylan thomas does neither. it is for people who think that the word awesome has some profound meaning and not as is the case an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction.  any suggestion that it deserves a best picture oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.,15
2014.11.07,5,i do not know what kind of pr team the production team has hired to promote this film but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than inception... seriously guys??? this film has 510 stars at best and even that for just potential. rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it. stupid illogical and at times really boring and long. even though i am no scientist it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that i have no comments to this.... set your expectations low no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here....,7
2023.01.14,10,its difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. in fact id go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. after watching this you somehow feel as if youve experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. there isnt a single moment that goes unwasted everything is purposeful. this is a scifi film in which the fi part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. it puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. to me one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. the film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. but perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. yes as humans we have our shortcomings. but we can also show remarkable empathy dedication and ingenuity. i would be lying if i said i wasnt highly emotional while watching this film. in fact i found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. i know this review wasnt very analytical  i will say the following though this film is so immersive and well done that you forget youre watching a film. the acting is simply superb and believable at all times. reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. the film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. from a composition perspective it might seem that there isnt a lot going on in the music. but the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke. i will end this review by saying that i truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. it reminded me of how powerful humans can be and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet.,22
2015.01.25,9,a team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanitys survival. going into this i had mixed feelings because some have praised it others have panned it and some say it is good with reservations. there were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters and any number of other issues. then when we get to the oscars the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors. this was wrong. maybe this is not the best role from matthew mcconaughey or anne hathaway. though the fact that a hathaway hater like myself enjoyed it should say something. and i think jessica chastain should have received a best supporting nomination. she easily outshines laura dern in wild. this may be the greatest ever film about physics.,10
2014.11.03,9,this is both a review of the film and an assertion of christopher nolans filmmaking style there have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film the visual effects the acting the music but say how its not christopher nolans best directed film. this is where i personally would have to disagree. before i get into it though ill talk about interstellar a bit. interstellar is truly a scifi epic like no other. to compare said film to 2001 a space odyssey isnt just a disservice but unnecessary. the films are almost nothing alike simply sharing small plot elements. also stanley kubricks vision of arthur c. clarkes scifi epic wasnt to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story but to make art and art is was and is. with interstellar mr. nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time time being a recurring theme throughout all of nolans films. but its so much more than that too. there are no words to express the epic journey nolan takes us on in the film but needless to say its tearjerking and emotional throughout. the acting is topnotch especially mcconaughey who gives i would say his most emotional performance yet. but the actor who stole the show in a few scenes one in particular when theyre on an alien planet was david gyasi as romilly one of the astronauts aboard the endurance their spacecraft. the musical score from hans zimmer is without a doubt his best and most influential work to date helping drive the films bold and breathtaking vision the church organ helped significantly. the visual effects are easily the best to date as well and of the year. to see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way with pages theoretical equations provided by kip thorne theoretical physicist of whoms work inspired the films genesis what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. but even everything else from the alien planets to the endurance the visuals always look real. then theres the writing. i would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue ive ever heard in a scifi movie and the script continually pours or oozes emotion keeping the audience tethered to the film. now about mr. nolan. dont just look at nolan but look at his films. some say inception would be his masterpiece while others would say its the dark knight or memento. but honestly every single film christopher nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre but of nolan. following is his quiet masterpiece not the film that put mr. nolan on the map as a phenomenal director but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to nolan after seeing memento what could be called his breakout masterpiece. then right after he directed the remake of the norwegian thriller insomnia. this too could be considered a masterpiece even if a remake. then we were given his take on the batman universe starting with batman begins the origin masterpiece. then theres the prestige adapted from the novel of the same name which can be called his dark masterpiece. the dark knight his bold masterpiece inception his complex masterpiece and the dark knight rises his flawed masterpiece. now we have interstellar his emotional or personal masterpiece. this is just my looking at nolan and his films but whatever your thoughts are you cant deny interstellar is one hell of a journey. he certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time and of all time. i cant wait to see what he does next but im not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as interstellar.,36
2022.12.26,10,the fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of nasa pilots who travel through a work hole in search of a new home. ive only watched it for the second time the first being when it first arrived on the big screen. my opinion hasnt altered since the viewing its an epic masterpiece the story holds up remarkably well but the acting and visuals all contribute to make this film something very special. the story is remarkably good its cohesive well balanced it makes sense. matthew mcconaugheys best film role still for me hes awesome as the lead character superbly supported by both anne hathaway and michael caine it really is a well made epic. the visuals the special effects are all tremendous and have held up as the years have gone past it remains one of the most incredibly beautiful visual films of all time. epic 1010.,7
2014.11.25,10,hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only earth but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. typically like the european explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the western hemisphere during the 15th century these extraterrestrialseither bugeyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmosshow up to evict or absorb us. inception director christopher nolans latest extravaganza interstellar toplining matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway jessica chastain michael caine and john lithgow is a superior space opera that reverses the action. earthlings must abandon mother earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. no interstellar doesnt pit earth against multicolored guardians of the galaxy aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the star wars and hunger games franchises. instead the interstellar scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials interstellar qualifies as an intelligent realistic sometimes provocative scifi saga similar to stanley kubricks landmark movie 2001 a space odyssey. mind you nolan doesnt chronicle mankinds evolution from the dawn of time the way kubrick did in as 2001. the casts of interstellar and 2001 a space odyssey differ too. kubrick relied on an unknown cast while interstellar boasts a charismatic array of superstars. if you havent seen 2001 a space odyssey you wont appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. anybody who has seen 2001 will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. ultimately the most obvious 2001 references in interstellar are those bizarre oblong minecraftstyle robots that resemble the black monoliths in kubricks film. some of the scifi terminology may fly over your head but christopher nolan and his brother jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. they focus on relevant contemporary themes such as father  daughter relationships and the environment. they forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie.  interstellar occurs in the late 21st century after things have waxed really wretched. bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. blight has destroyed wheat and okra. public opinion about nasa has curdled. history textbooks have been rewritten. everybody believes nasa faked the apollo moon landings to bankrupt the soviet union. a former nasa test pilot cooper matthew mcconaughey of mud has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. although his wife died from a brain cyst that an mri could have detected had an mri had been available cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children his fifteenyear old son tom timothe chalamet of worse friends and his precious tenyear old daughter murph mackenzie foy of the conjuring who adore him. cooper and his kids live with his fatherinlaw donald john lithgow of terms of endearment and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. these dust storms recall the depression era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. dust gets into everything and donald wages a neverending war to keep everything clean. meanwhile books have been toppling randomly from murphs bedroom bookcase. she suspects a ghost is responsible but nothing ghoulish like paranormal activity. naturally cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. one day after a particularly turbulent dust storm father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves translate it into code and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified norad facility. a monolithic robot named tars confronts them. later murph and cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with highranking nasa officials. one of them is professor brand michael caine of batman begins and brand confides in cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. moreover he tells him about the lazarus project. nasa has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. he convinces cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter biologist amelia oscar winning actress anne hathaway of les misrables physicist romilly david gyasi geographer doyle wes bentley of the hunger games and two robots tars voice of bill irwin and case voice of josh stewart deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. predictably murph isnt happy about her fathers departure. during their flight to the wormhole cooper and company lose contact with earth but professor brand can still transmit messages. gradually however things take a turn for the worst. the final quarter hour of interstellar will absolutely boggle your mind. cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind!  interstellar is a serious scifi movie. the computergenerated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling and nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we dont hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. the different spacecraft and the endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. the strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new earth are breathtaking. one world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. the theme of deception runs throughout interstellar. the faked apollo moon landing and dr. brands mindblowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout interstellar. nolan generates several suspenseful setpieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. matt damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. clocking in at 169 minutes interstellar amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense whiteknuckled suspense topnotch performances and a terrific ending.,53
2014.11.05,10,interstellar was incredible. the visuals the score the acting were all amazing. the plot is definitely one of the most original ive seen in a while. most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable but i have to disagree. yes there were some parts that were definitely in the fi part of scifi. but the thing is interstellar deals with concepts that we know very little about. we have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. i dont think its fair to call something unbelievable when we have absolutely no idea what would be believable in those circumstances. either way excellent writing from the nolan brothers. the visuals were outstanding and will no doubt be nominated for an oscar. the performances were excellent though nothing oscar worthy as is the case with most of nolans films the dark knight being the obvious exception. hans zimmers score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. all in all interstellar is an excellent movie which i personally think is nolans most beautiful film to date.,13
2014.11.11,6,dont get me wrong im a sucker for most of nolans and his brothers works but this one just doesnt rise up to the standard of filmmaking that were used to from these guys.  where to start? the overtly obvious and clich ending? if youve seen any movie involving spacetime puzzles and paradoxes you see it coming from miles away. one might say thats not the point of the movie that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. well sorry folks the nolans seem to talk the talk but they cant walk the walk. the dramatic content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. it relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesnt really give us the psychological background of the characters as to why they do what they do.  some clich shots explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in event horizon. the girl running after the car of the departing father only to be held by another loved one queue dramatic music wow i havent seen that before. the beings or us in the future simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacitiescome on matthew youve done that movie already! the robots look like monoliths from 2001. well if youre gonna be inspired by kubrick be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece. human nature is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. yeah we have survival instinct also compassion for our loved ones which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. so where are all these forcedtearjerker scenes coming from? what else is new since 2001 or solaris? is that all there is to it? a movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre but instead it is a faint copy easily forgettable. what weve seen previously from these guys in films like the following memento and also in dark knight hell even inception is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. none of that complexity is to be found in this movie. the characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci fi movie stereotypes.  the dramatic substance of the movie which is literally thrown to our faces every moment does not live up to the quality of its technical execution. sure the visuals are great but thats to be expected from a 169 million movie. music is great too though sometimes overused but its hans zimmer for crying out loud. what i enjoyed was the layout of the dystopic future perhaps a little emphasis on how the world came to be that way would have made for a better and more plausible moviedont even get me started on the absurd physics of this movie. good luck running from a blackhole. simply put this film is by no means a 9 and it simply doesnt qualify for the top250 though of course there are many titles there which dont qualify even for the top875384.,28
2022.07.06,10,this movie is no doubt the best ive ever scene this movie gives you everything emotionslovehypeexcitementetc.. in my opinion this is the best movie made by christopher nolan. the ending is so good that i had to watch it twice i loved this movie so much and tbh i dont think any movie will top this one for me .,3
2015.08.29,6,this is a movie with plenty of things going for it. great performances incredible visual effects an interesting story and tons of really cool concepts which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes however that doesnt make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. there are tons of people giving this movie 1010 ratings leading to a user rating of 8.7 and it is now 29 on the imdb top 250. wow! that is a lot of praise! on the top 250 interstellar is above casablanca raiders of the lost ark psycho apocalypse now and citizen kane! according to the users on imdb this movies better than citizen kane which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time! is is better than citizen kane? no not even close. the film is full of flaws the biggest being the runtime. i may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! it feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded and were made just so the movie could be longer because christopher nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. im sure if nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out it wouldve been better. a film by nolan that is better than this one is the dark knight which has a somewhat long runtime but it feels way shorter than its runtime and is extremely entertaining throughout. interstellar is so long that it starts to really drag on and at times i began to just zone out. the film is also a bit too dramatic. the dialogue about how love conquers all seemed very unnecessarily corny as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. however some sequences were quite powerful especially the ending which actually was kind of creepy. the concept of time was very prominent throughout the film and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences. overall the film is recommended but you should be warned that this movie was loooooooong!!!!!!,21
2014.11.19,4,if you saw sunshine and thought wow good thing they had scientist advisers this stuff is so plausible you will like interstellar. if you saw armaggeddon and thought what an awesome movie i just wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his daughter out even more you will like interstellar. if you saw inception and thought this movie would be so much better in space! you will like interstellar. and if you liked 2001 or any other intelligentgeeky scifi movie you will hate interstellar. like some of nolans earlier works its long for the sake of length only. its plot is up there with armaggeddon in pure stupidity and forced uscowboypatriotmachoism its special effects are underwhelming its plot twists are obvious its setting makes no sense its characters are flat and forgettable and its constant citations of 2001 just serve to make you remember how much better kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back. disappointing.,8
2019.07.01,10,i rate this movie 1110 to signify its greatness. perfection. mindblowing. a workout for your brain. i want to have debates about it. i want to write research papers on it. amazingly unbelievably awesome. this is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. lots of amazing scenes with epic music. a killer story told flawlessly. perfect directing by the best ever. great cast with great acting. a deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters. the most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest as well as a retired astronaut whos been to space five times. one of the rare movies that is better the second and even the third time watching. the only movie i have ever liked the most the fourth time. i keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. so many parts are extremely moving and powerful. it does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling. edit on tenth viewing this movie destroys me every time. numerous tears every time. and i dont just mean at the obvious emotional parts. there are so many moments where i am in complete awe at the beauty of the filmmaking im experiencing to the point of tears. the way the story all comes together and the epiphany moment is so perfect that it brings me to tears. when watching movies i sometimes think this is the best thing ive ever seen or this is the coolest thing ive ever seen. i know its hyperbole and ive said it many times usually at one or maybe two scenes in a movie. during interstellar i feel this way for about 40 of this three hour movie. every time i watch it reemphasizes that it is cleary my favorite movie of alltime. and that musical score alone gives me goosebumps for so much of the movie. hans is the goat. nolan is the goat. 11 viewings 1222016 2262020 1112022 892023 imax rerelease 1262024 spoilers i was randomly thinking about interstellar havent watched it in at least 6 months. i thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. if plan b was what originally happened and dr. brand survived future people figured it out and they want to save those they left behind on earth they need to find a lovelink between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem  cooper and murph. doctor brand knows this because she knows cooper loves murph knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole knows murph grows up to be her dads understudy so she has the future people eventually after her death put the machine in the same black hole that cooper falls into thereby making the entire plan work. intriguing. will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again i like this as a viable theory but it conflicts with another theory i had about the original mission being completed without cooper. lots of awesome concepts that made me think like murphys law not applying close to a black hole human survival instincts and it encompassing your children love being a quantifiable scientific force the black hole and time relativity. the robots are cool and original. really awesome visuals of things ive wondered about but never really imagined. i liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3d in the daughters room. the way everything connected is very awesome. the different planets are so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. the endings are perfect. something i noticed that i didnt realize the first time is the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. he was still a good person even after experiencing the death of his son jesse. however once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband father and brother. the relationship between coop and murph is the best relationship i can remember in any movie ive seen. the primary underlying theme in the movie is the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time which is the key to her getting the information she needs to save the world. from interstellar group chat discussion or the other theory i had was that originally plan b was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan a work so she finds out that plan a was a sham. that the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. that he knew even with solving the equation that they couldnt figure out how to get the people off earth. she found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. so every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. she should have never been hoping. her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste. that should break a person. murph is a beast. the love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. its the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. its the only reason she went back to her house in her room. its the only reason she saw the watch again. its the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data. 12216 i watched interstellar again wow. i found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used plan b without cooper and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. the problem is how would they have gotten past the problems with redocking onto the spinning blown up ship after mann backstabbed humanity. but it actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline cooper would not have convinced them to go to manns planet brand would have convinced them to go to edmunds planet which was the right one. in that original timeline love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet.,70
2015.05.03,10,the ones that you still think of weeks even months later. the ones that make you think and leave you breathless. the ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours. i watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. the thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. as childish as it sounds its true because its one of those movies. interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far. bravo nolan what a great human bean,8
2014.11.04,10,love is the one thing that transcends time and space...  new creation of christopher nolans genius whose name is now known to everyone. his films are waiting with a special look because it offers something that every day unfortunately less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema  an interesting spectacle filled with meaning ideas and emotions. at this time christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams and even not on the dark streets of gotham city. no now he send us to the journey to and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible through the curvature of space and time in other worlds. and you wont forget this trip this can be assured.  i was madly waiting for interstellars release. and then finally i was able to see this beauty  at the premiere in my coutry on october 29. it was incredibly exciting. it was a delight. it was unforgettable. it was gorgeous. nolan once again amazes the viewers imagination by his painting. journey to the brink of infinity the line where humanity has never set acts as either the firstborn purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. a loving father who mankind need to help but that he should leave his children and a loving daughter who doesnt want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.  starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits a new picture of nolan will absorb you completely forcing stare at the screen during the whole action because its all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. no this three hours wont fly quickly for you. youll feel every emotion every event every character. you will not look how the main characters travel through the universe because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of endurance starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself. the emotional core of this story is the relationship of matthew mcconaugheys character and his daughter  mackenzie foy and jessica chastain character. and the acting work of these three artists in interstellar impress the most. mcconaughey was acting really great and this is one of the most emotional if not the most emotional role of his life. all the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. anne hathaway wes bentley michael caine casey affleck ellen burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the films supporting characters very realistic. i would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of matt damon a character who has received quite memorable. if we talk about the characters it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. one of them adds a touch of humor in the film which mitigates constantly depressing dramatic and sometimes really dark atmosphere. the script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between cooper and murph. the story is complex and complicated is based on real scientific theories by kip thorne and indeed contains a reference to the space odyssey and other scifi pictures. this story about true love about loyalty forgiveness fraud hard decisions and much more. and it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. its also possible to notice some structure allusion to another nolans work  inception. the story and visuals are combined just perfectly in interstellar. hans zimmers score written by him on the basis of only one letter from nolan hold the key once we become parents we cant help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children deserves a special praise. on this basis hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. and this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. it is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. very impressive work which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.  visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. the endurance itself new worlds insanely beautiful and mysterious space wormholes black holes and travel through them folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. i would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. it must be seen. that mastery with which this is done not just words. in the visual pattern also has some references to the kubricks odyssey and they are pleasing to the eye. many thanks to christopher nolan for having given us such an incredible movie which once again proved to us that the cinema is nolans life.  interstellar is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its scifi splendor but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. this film is not only about the discoveries space exploration and the final frontier of mankind but also about the relationship of father and daughter who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. so with what nolans genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. combining the story filled with not only real science fiction but the true human values and emotions outstanding and very emotional performances breathtaking visuals epic and dramatic soundtrack christopher nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.  do not go gentle into that good night... rage rage against the dying of the light.,51
2023.03.13,10,the key of this movie may feel like youre watching only a sciencefiction movie. most of the times scifi movies are not great at telling an effective emotional drama stories. you cant find this type of movie easily unless you are watching a scifi movie directed by christopher nolan and written by jonathan nolan. mixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. all the nolans projects are a bit dangerous and special. not only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great! brilliant scores that composed by hans zimmer. the film editing is just beyond perfect. one of the best film editings of all time. the cinematography by wally pfister is quite realistic and charming. the vfx are just stunning. even the scientist are amazed by how great it is. some of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories so that makes it a bad movie. as you may know all the movies are based on wrong things. you are watching a scifi movie. in being realistic scifi movies are just one step ahead of fantasy. why would you look for reality in this movies? its not a crime movie. if people would demand realistic movies there would be a bigger documentary sector. the main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. its mixed. some of the theories are proven some of them has potential to be true some of them are not likely true. but you cant make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. even based on a true story movies are so changed to make it more effective. you cant name any scifi movie that based on all true theories. other scifi movies are not explaining the questions at all. and somehow when this movie tries to explain this movie becames faulty. so better not trying to explain whats going on? in this movie there is no major flaw that you cant ignore. the main story is just so effective and perfect.,30
2020.11.15,10,the earth is plagued with droughts famines and other apocalyptic disasters. mankind must find a way to leave planet earth once and for all. an earthlike planet has been discovered in another solar system. a spaceship can travel fast through a wormhole though interstellar space but can cooper get there and return to earth in time to see his daughter before she grows too old? the aging of murph vs her father cooper the answer is relativity playing a factor in aging  how fast time runs depend on the relative position of the observer and the subject. incredible movie  highly recommended! 1010,7
2014.11.04,9,so last night i got the chance to see the early screening of christopher nolans interstellar. the film ive been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. how did it fare? heres my take to avoid any tldr risk let me get this straight from the very beginning interstellar is one goddamnedly good film it gets you to the edge of your seat it soars it warps it rips your brain senseless. its that good. interstellar is a story about the earth dying with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn and of course it will lead to the extinction of humanity. our hero is an exnasa test pilot named cooper matthew mcconaughey a typical ordinaryguyinanextraordinary situation everyman whos also a dedicated family man especially toward his daughter murphy named after the murphys law. in an alltooarmageddon style our hero gets invited by the publicly defunct nasa to become humanitys last hope in finding a new home for they have found a wormhole near saturn 2001 anyone? which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. solid and compact premise although its been used before. for seasoned filmgoers there are many similar elements although its understandable with stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and robert zemeckis contact 1997. in a sense that this is not a bangbangshootshootblowemup scifi but more of a slowburning metaphysical scifi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time. similarity with 2001 and contact is never a bad thing but it becomes a wee bit too predictable although nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final a very sentimental one i should say twist in the story. the visuals in this film is majestic everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level nolanstyle. the space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like cuarons gravity but unlike the documentary feel of gravity theres a real gusto and pace to these scenes. you should also be prepared for the for some maybe unexpected third act it is nolans most sentimental and humane moment to date. and this is why interstellar is more than just a sciencefiction it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop. one thing that nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. nolan was never a warm director his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold it maybe suits memento and the dark knight but in interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the scifi that will be interstellars forte. the result is a rather incongruous script intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. but it is a forgivable sin for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. at the end of the day all i can say is that interstellar is a grand film. it is monolithic thoughtful sentimental sophisticated visceral but also with its flaws. i wouldnt say its nolans best work to date but i daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released. after watching interstellar do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see contact 1997 and 2001 a space odyssey 1968 to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown. because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us frightens us and brings out the best in us.,26
2014.11.11,6,i am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. it was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script story and the future of the world basically.i am sure it will grab few awards in these categories. there was a similar hype around avatar but when i saw avatar it had something new to offer. interstellar doesnt offer anything new as such.if you put the movie gravity and the movie frequency together in 5d wormhole angle you have intersetllar.in fact i found frequency to be highly underrated movie. actingdirection is good but wished the script were much more stronger.,8
2023.01.19,10,ive probably watched this movie for the 10th time and wanted to watch it with my mum this time. every time i cry in this movie. im 31 years old and i fall for it everytime. probably one of the most beautiful movies ive ever seen in my life. mathew and anne put on the performances of their lives while engaging the audience at every corner in the movie. 3 hours is a long time for a movie to run for yet by the end of the credits your yearning for more and wishing it wasnt ending. this still ranks as one of the best movies ive ever seen and i dont think that will change anytime soon. special enthralling epic and just perfect in every way.,8
2014.11.09,6,interesting in parts but i aged 23 years watching it. derivative of many other films including contact 2001 forbidden planet signs and most egregiously north by northwest. worst score in recent memory. also some of the special effects are pretty lameall too obvious when models are being used. gravity was much more visually arresting. way too many close up horror expressions. the universe is supposed to be filled by interstellar gas which must be true given so much gassy dialog. nolan manages to work in the do not go gently into that good night poem not once but four times look for the last time on a plague at the end.,8
2014.11.07,5,spoiler free begins  i had a sneaking feeling that christopher nolan was a director who wasnt particularly good at staging emotional sequences nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre the dark knight rises and overall logical setup of the batman series or sublime memento inception. what always worked for nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good he made classics. interstellar represents a colossal failure of nolan on every front imaginable. lets start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. the plot involving the worlds end and the attempt to save it via interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a michael bay movie. if you could complain about gravitys leaps of logic then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. the story is a galaxy sized plot hole. the sad part is that it isnt even original which you would come to expect from the nolan brothers. its a bad mishmash of gravity coherence 2001 a space odyssey and contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting dialogues staging and poor editing story and what not. if you were expecting an inception than dont interstellar has the most contrived sci fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. its armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. at least i enjoyed armageddon. spoiler free ends  now back to the plot points. lets talk about the plot. the world is ending and i could not fathom why nor could nolan show us the world in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by nasa. if the world is ending who will save it? of course the aliens or they insert oooooooooooh. i thought the movie would involve humans discovering interstellar travel.i never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass worm hole was conveniently placed by 5 dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. how hokey is that? and the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work ah its shaped like a sphere! or how time dilation works in relativity theory. it seems like none of johnathan or christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills oh we lost so many years. and talking about cheap thrills can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? okay lets talk about the ending. one can apparently fly into a black hole make contact with 5dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? how? by transmitting some mumbojumbo data via morse code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? how did it work? hokey as hell. and the visuals? oh the problem is since gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years what could instellar do? well lets have some obviously fake looking cgi dust clouds. have your space ship fly over a windows wallpaper of saturn. how was any of it original? lets look at the planet. one has water with a fake wall of waves one has simply ice. thats it. water and ice. where did you spend your money on mr nolan? oh the robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good robot design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground. and the acting? cringeworthy mumblecore. i dont think even the fanboys can save this one.,46
2022.12.12,10,have you ever wondered why there are so few good movies? some movies have good story some have delightful music some have acting masterpieces and some movies have all of them together. enjoying this movie is the easiest thing possible. words are not the only means of expressing feelings. life is planting the seeds of love. life is mental water that flows. life is not about being alive its about being free . i havent seen this movie for years because i want to forget it and give me the same new and great feeling again. but alas legend never dies. i invite you to watch this movie. the next hours will be the best hours of your life.,11
2014.11.04,10,just watched interstellar in imax 70mm. science fiction fans can read on everyone else can skip. movie is a visual masterpiece. like his earlier movies christopher nolan once again proved how big a movie can be! there were some shotswhich made audience go crazy..some scenes were as epic as 2001 a space odyssey. do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. this one is not for action fans. at times movie go highly sentimental matthew mcconaughey does what he is best in and supposed to. i recommend this movie to all the scifi fans out there make sure you go in group of scifi nuts!! do not go with the hype..go sit back and enjoy. just like inception this movie will be known as great after few monthsi know people who said inception was a crap when it released and after few months rating it 1010 in imdb d. i dont wanna spoil anythingif you want pm me. also make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. if you loved donnie darko 2001 a space odyssey this is the one for you get ready to get mind blown!! interstellar movie is epic in all sense!!,17
2014.11.11,10,the most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit. they look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited. the movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. those robots there are amazing as well complete opposite of marvin from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. i love them. the emotional layer is as great as it gets. you may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible. it all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the universe encountering strangest parts of physics.,9
2014.11.13,10,chris nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by matthew mconnaughey another oscar performance who was a n.a.s.a pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that i wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but i wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a renascence first of all it is incredibly beautiful to watch. honestly it was so beautiful that i felt like i was sucked into the movie. the way nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of christopher nolan just by looking at the way it is filmed. the techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. the sound environment is just mesmerizing. it is a very important part of the movie because some scenes take place in space and noland just found the right way to use sound. the soundtrack made by the great hans zimmer is breathtaking epic amazing unreal. i could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronaut matthew in this movie... well he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. but matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story which is very important in interstellar. he is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story as a father as a human. anne hathaway was very convincing all together the actors managed to create some harmony which makes the human interactions credible. caine chastaing and affleck are a perfect choice. and then there is... the special guest who is mischievous in a minor role  is actually much more important than that. he proves once again that he is a great actor. watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene  and finally the scenariostory. i wont spoil anything here ill just try to convince you how great it is. nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. well once again he did it. with the dark knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. with interstellar hes revolutionizing the scifi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. and we can feel and see just as spielberg did in the 80s nolan is doing it now today nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done brace yourselves my friends we have not seen anything yet.  why? well simply because we only know a few things about space some things cant be proved for the moment so we can use theory and make the best of it. that is exactly what nolan did. he used theories that exist today and made a movie about mankind about pioneers about humanity about us. whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work michael caine was about my rating for this movie can only be a 10this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe this is the scifi movie of the decade and probably the best movie nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted do not go gentle into that good night... rage rage against the dying of the light.,37
2014.12.25,8,to this day  many people still talk a lot about christopher nolans batmantrilogy but here is his newest work interstellar. he gets help from michael caine and anne hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. one year after cuarn with gravity he discovers the endless widths of space as well. the difference however is that a large part of his movie including the first 40 minutes or so completely plays down on planet earth. however it is also about survival in space including two people instead of one though. or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate. this is like our generations armageddon only that it is much better and much more edgeoftheseat. the lead character is played by matthew mcconaughey whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an academy award win. interstellar is much more than scifi though. i personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. the water planet sequence was incredibly well done. and right afterward when cooper mcconaughey sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents it is truly moving as well. i had a lump in my throat just like i did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. the inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really. then i also had a lovehate relationship with the matt damon parts. i found it pretty boring to be honest initially but when we found out about his true intentions it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. nicely done. when caines character mentioned him with high praise early on i felt there could be something fishy like with pixars up there and yes it was. the ending of the movie with hathaways character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. saving private... ehh i mean dr. brand. who knows? the time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. somehow the nasa lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in american school books. it is some point in the future. that much we know. david oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. he has selma in the race for an academy award nomination this year. the ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion but i still liked it. the whole ghost explanation about cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. the effects are brilliant of course but that does not really need be mentioned for nolan movies. a given. hans zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from mcconaugheys charm if you like that and some droll robot creatures. anyway i found the film interesting enough that i found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet with hathaways characters lover only the water planet and the ice planet. id have loved to see that. however maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. the movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the threehour mark. it could have run for another hour and i probably would not have been bored. there really was hardly anything wrong with it. afflecks character did not do too much for me. he wasnt particularly wellacted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to chastains character the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to cooper. john lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always. this is one of the movies i really recommend to watch preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. its also good for a rewatch i believe also to evaluate the characters actions especially caines for example. and the story of course. i believe after one viewing i am still far away from having understood everything that was going on especially the scientific aspects. that however does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the films great acting and emotional impact. if you are interested in space you really have to see this too. it has distant planets wormholes black holes spaceships and a lot more. let me finish this review with two little snippets first the actress who played murph as a child was the same that played renesmee in the last two twilight movies and secondly that fittingly hathaways character was called amelia like the aviation pioneer amelia earhart. that cant be coincidence can it? especially with her last shot.,53
2014.11.08,6,there is a lot i like about this movie. i love the overall themes of the end of mankind on this planet and trying to find a new home. everything youd expect to work in a film of this budget does work it looks awesome the actors are good the score is great etc. these things are what make this movie worthy of the prize to a ticket. while i give nolan credit for taking on these huge themes i dont think he quite delivers with this one. of course with a movie like this theres gonna be plot holes and you could nitpick it to peaces and that can be enjoyable part of a movie too. the biggest problem with me was the human side of the story on the emotional elements. i do think nolan did good job convincing us of how hight the stakes were on this mission. and i enjoyed the elements about the relevance of time and how years past in the earth while theyve only experienced a couple of hours. the big human element of the story is the relationship with a father and a daughter and that just doesnt work well enough. its almost laughable how long it takes for the daughter to forgive her dad for leaving her for the sake of mankind. even though she works in the same facility that send her dad away in the first place. i guess its dramatically better that she sends her first message to him when shes the same age he was when he left but it just doesnt make much sense. also brands speech about love being an element that reaches over time and space is just laughable. you could do that with any other emotion and still have it make as much sense. i also found the emotional scenes to bee too manipulative. i just didnt feel for the characters as much as i should have. the scene with cooper and old murph was just stupid. they havent seen in decades and have both experienced more than most people could imagine with huge emotional package. and they spend like two minutes talking to each other. and coopers grand children and grandgrand children dont even talk to him even though hes supposed to be some kind of a legend. they just silently leave the room when he arrives. in general the movie was just overly chewed and explained. they should have left more stuff up to the interpretation of the viewer 2001s style. but i still dont regret seeing the film. it is quite an experience visually. and for that reason the stuff that doesnt work is such a shame.,27
2024.12.10,10,its difficult to put into words how breathtaking and epic this movie is. it is the greatest film i have ever seen. the blending of a close intimate father daughter relationship with a larger than life space expedition to save humanity is executed brilliantly by nolan and crew. the visual effects story line writing acting and scientific accuracy were all perfect in my eyes but its the sheer emotion of the film that gets you. multiple scenes will have you wiping your eyes as nolans manipulation of time in this movie does a brilliant job of evoking never before felt emotions in the viewer. a true masterpiece of cinema.,6
2015.03.13,6,i have to begin this review by acknowledging that i saw this movie under less than optimal conditions  on the screen on the back of a jet blue seat. whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small and the sound was murky. theres a good chance i would have liked this film better if seen properly. that being said i probably wouldnt have liked it a lot better because the things i didnt like would have been the same. first off i thought the movie was off to a real slow start. it was basically a dust bowl family saga and while ill admit you needed some context for what happens later it felt like it went on much too long. the early space experience also didnt engage me that much. part of the problem might just be my expectations for a christopher nolan movie. i knew almost nothing about this film going in but i think of nolan as the director of inception and memento and interstellar was just so darn straightforward at least at first. eventually the movie is almost three hours so it really takes its time the films more intriguing ideas appear such as the trickiness of relative time. the movie also becomes more eventful. yet still there were things i found offputting the first death in the movie makes no sense it shouldnt have happened and realistically wouldnt have. later i read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldnt have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.  the movie did become more engrossing as it got more involved playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments.  alas whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good and perhaps it was yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly with way too much leaning on nonscience things like intuition. and the last scenes were just .... huh? although someone in the imdb board came up with a very christopher nolan interpretation of the end that i found more appealing. as i say if id seen it on the big screen i might have been more forgiving of its flaws and its very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. but even saying that i cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others.,21
2014.11.07,4,yesterday i watched the movie interstellar. a poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an oversimplified pseudoscience and spoonfed philosophical implications basically a typically overrated hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001 a space odyssey from kubrick with none of its beauty simplicity and none of its art. it shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they cant even copy it decently. the fact that on imdb it has an higher rating than the kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. i will watch 2001 a space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again.,5
2014.11.05,10,wow...!!! its almost impossible to put in words but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve. in my modest opinion interstellar is the best scifi in human history. believe it or not. its the simple and the complicated its the usual and the different its the mind and the heart its an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. its an original story and thoughtprovoking masterpiece. every single time with him you just got crazy about his ideas astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart. back then he was an ambitious young director. and with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. now he is an icon and a legend of directing. he is christopher nolan... really guys whats wrong with this guy ?!! whats going on inside his head ?!! its our job to honor the honorable. please just keep the rating up why ? because chris. and interstellar deserve it.,17
2014.11.12,10,wowser! this christopher nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that i went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. but i was frankly blown away with it. just about everyone raves about christopher nolans work and you look back at his filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume from memento via the rather overhyped imho dark knight batman seriesreboot through to inception one of my favourite films of all time. for me interstellar is right up there with inception for thoughtprovoking visually spectacular and truly epic cinema. we start in familiar day after tomorrow territory with mankind having in some way  not entirely explained  messed up the planet. as i understood it and the film probably does require multiple watches with  see comments below  subtitleson the rather clever premise is that the worlds food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive blight. this delivers the double whammy of destroying mankinds provisions but also by massive reproduction of the organism progressively depleting the earths oxygen. for some reason  again which i didnt get on first viewing  this is accompanied by massive dust storms. it is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the midwest population first starvation lung disease or suffocation. matthew mcconnaughey plays the widowed cooper an exnasa drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by missionleader professor brand an excellent michael caine to pilot a nasa mission. the goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect through previous work that a new home for mankind could be found. the first part of the film is set on and around coopers farm setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film that cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father john lithgow again superb and young children murph aged 10 and tom aged 15 whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything timewise for when he returns. cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including brands daughter played by a lovestruck anne hathaway who again shows she can act. to say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. however i would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake dr mann in a surprise cameo is equally good looking! lol. in terms of plus points where do i start? the visuals are utterly stunning. whilst reminiscent in places of kubricks stargate from 2001 the similarity is only passing. the film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects this might have just been me of course but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous. equally stunning is hans zimmers score which is epic and in places very very loud. the film certainly doesnt go quietly into the night! when matching the noise of the scorechoir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is earbleedingly effective. this must be a strong contender for the soundtrack oscar for 2014. one quibble again 2001 related is that zimmer uses the last chord of also sprach zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes richard strausss estate receives some royalties! the acting is top notch ive already mentioned caine and lithgow but mcconnaughey hathaway and jessica chastain are all great. a particular shoutout should go to mackenzie foy as the young murph who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role. above all nolans direction is exquisite. the film has a slow build on earth which adds to the lengthy running time but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. and some of the editing cuts  again coopers farm departurelaunch sequence overlay is a great example  are superb in building the mood and the tension. ive decided that i am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. where i could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack which was pretty inaudible in places mcconnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. i look forward to the dvd subtitles. and one of the characters dying words  delivering a key plot point in the film  was completely lost to me but thankfully later restated. whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious the end of the film playing fast and loose with physics i fear requires a gravitydefying suspension of belief although i guess the same could equally be said of 2001 a space odyssey. however the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours i will make a rare exception to my rating rule. overall this is a topnotch scifi film. and a final word people this is a must see on the big screen! if you enjoyed this review please see my archive of previous reviews at bobthemovieman.com and sign up for future notifications. thanks.,43
2024.07.19,10,i mean seriously. i am such a movie fan. i watch everything. nothing comes close to this. this movie changed me. interstellar is a revelation! its themes are incredible. how love can be a quantifiable force. love for ones children. the quest for a better life for them. the strength and courage it takes to step into the unknown. the ties that we share with our people. and if you are just a little bit of a nerd it leaves a mark forever!... performances are stellar. all actors are giving it their all. i am not a fan of anne hathaway and i even loved her! also zimmers score is sheer perfection. it will make you cry and ponder. best movie ever.,19
2015.04.03,9,a lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. it has all the elements of a nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. this time he went a little too far. the story behind the movie has its flaws. there really is no explanation of what happenedis happening. instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. all in all the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. but since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off the story really kicks in. the main part of the movie gives a great ride pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. the problem i personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on earth was less shown than i expected. a different approach was expected but that did not stop chastain from giving the best role in the movie. the last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. but the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. i heard that this was called the most scientifically accurate movie and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. nevertheless way too much theoretical physics in the end. since i love sf movies i am willing to look past the over thetop science part but what really got to me was that it was predictable. from the very moment i saw a black hole in the movie i put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. regarding the acting as i said before chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. she doesnt have much screen time but she sure knows how to use it. the two that actually lead the movie  mcconaughey and hathaway were brilliant. mcconaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. his performance was outstanding. hathaway was good decent without a single word that can be said against her but for a movie like this that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors she should have done more. the others did a good job particularly casey affleck whos character was a grand comparison to chastains. the music given it was done by the mastermind hans zimmer was spectacular. just the right notes just the right timing just the right music. his understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. all in all interstellar is a magnificent movie. it is a type of movie nolan does best. it has all the elements of being a classic like kubricks 2001 a space odyssey it comes really close to being the new space odyssey and it will not perish with time. still this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer a lot has to be digested here it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. but if your braincells dont shut off and you dont expect another die hard movie you will appreciate this masterpiece.,32
2014.11.08,10,plot the year is unknown but most likely close to present time. the earth is running out of resources and a group of underground nasa workers seek the help of engineerastronaut turned farmer mr. cooper in taking a journey across the galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side. that is the gist of the exposition of the plot. its mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. on paper this sounds like a typical scifi plot but chris nolan executes it like never before. the movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films and i think i have an explanation. nolan and his team had too much faith in its audience. the movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. the talk of wormholes and black holes are key to the movie. but i know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. after all physicist kip thorne was a consultant for the movie! i found it quite educational interesting but also over done at times. a good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. i personally loved it and was never lost but i could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length.  i found this movie to be amazing. sure at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. there was a scene where a major character is dying and as he speaks his last words its almost impossible to decipher what is said. it was also almost unintentionally humorous. but that was a small price to pay and im sure the subtitles of the blu ray release will save that scene for me. the directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. the camera angles really bring the movie to life. simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. the visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space on the foreign planet or even the decaying earth. the music of the film by hans zimmer deserves so much recognition! i will even say it was better than the score for inception. it really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. there are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! the acting was top class. matthew m gave one of the greatest human performances in history as mr. cooper. i seriously think it was better than his dallas buyers oscar winning performance. i really hope he gets recognition for this. there are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. he was just amazing. anne hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed bland. jessica chastain has a few strong moments as well. there is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. the supporting cast all do justice to the movie too but matthew and jessica gave the best performances without a doubt. in a way this movie resembles inception in certain areas. inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams the real world and limbo. interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. in inception a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. in interstellar a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. in inception a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. in interstellar the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. in both movies the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. inceptions main character doesnt want to see his childrens faces until they are truly reunited. but in interstellar he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. this movie is full of christopherjonathan nolanisms.  overall i think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. it was a true experience. be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. it will make you think. at times it might make you check your watch but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. even if you think you didnt like the film there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll.,56
2015.11.05,10,interstellar is a science fiction film cowritten and directed by christopher nolan inception batman the dark knight etc. and starring matthew mcconaughey. i found it absolutely amazing rarely do i use a word like spellbinding to describe a movie but i really do feel like interstellar is well worthy of it. matthew mcconaughey was excellent as well. he really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor. the story is about a group of explorers led by former pilot and engineer cooper matthew mcconaughey who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet saturn. their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated earth. the film was not only beautiful to look at but it was very well written too. however like with inception you really need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. its difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so youll just have to see for yourself. i rate it a very high 9.510 and i highly recommend it to any fan of christopher nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. i personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films ive ever seen.,13
2023.07.06,6,this movie requires blind faith in theoretical physics as much as religion requires blind faith. and im not talking mainstream blind faith  im talking mormonscientology levels of blind faith. the best one can do is just watch it as a film and not get caught up in the science or lack there of. as a film they spend way too much time with the family in the beginning. time that should have been dedicated to the actual space travel. a very slow burn but the acting is great. a serious lack of explanation for things they want you to swallow for the story to make sense. i give it a one time watch value of 7 with a rewatch value of 4. together  a 6. decent but the hype around this film makes no sense almost as much as the science involved.,10
2019.03.01,10,one of the greatest sci fi films of all time. christopher nolan proves that he is a master director with every film including interstellar.,2
2014.11.10,7,interstellar pretends to be more intelligent than alfonso cuarns audiovisual roller coaster gravity but ironically its best moments are those which like gravity rely purely on thrill and spectacle. for the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with mcconaughey and his crew or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantumphysics babble which if youre like me will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in csi with brief moments of levity provided by the two weirdly cubic looking robots tars and case. their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous it ends up impossible to take them seriously albeit exciting to watch. we already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight yet theyve managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. one wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldnt have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole. glaring plot issues aside and there are many the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole accompanied by hans zimmers electrifying score props to zimmer for once not composing something that sounded exactly like pirates of the caribbean making full use of the imax experience. performances are fairly solid in particular jessica chastain as the grown up murph and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening even if you cant quite understand it. definitely worth watching on the big screen but would i give it a 910? no way. this is a film that you will enjoy on face value but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. there are just too many inconsistencies contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece but id give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value.,12
2014.11.12,3,ok my first imdb review. i really wanted to like this movie. i love nolans work and im a science fiction fan. sadly within an hour i was wondering if i could stick out another two hours. the actors are all great and they get the few stars im willing to give it. i will admit that directing a big production like this is not for the fainthearted and ill give nolan points for that. however the story is so poorly constructed it just piles on frustration after frustration. other reviewers on here have described the litany of illogical errors. i havent read all 900 reviews but we have long known that black holes eat stars and planets and when they do they give off titanic bursts of gamma and xray radiation that would sterilize entire regions of a galaxy. im willing to suspend my disbelief in service of just enjoying a movie but when the entire premise is to find a more suitable home for human life and then you choose a planet apparently orbiting a black hole well that just goes from suspension to just outright disbelief. if batman had chosen to just use his magic freeze gun to stop the nuke in gotham i think most batman fans would have been groaning. thats the way someone like me feels about lazy plot devices like this.  there is also way too much unnecessary dialogue in this movie the superb cast are wasted saying clichd and hackneyed lines. the whole punchline of the ghost you could see coming in the first hour so you just ended up wondering how they would get there over the next 109 minutes. im sorry but i thought the music was intensely annoying and was just designed to jar you awake every half an hour. then there is the whole dont open the airlock! dont open the airlock! i was sitting there thinking just open the damn airlock and get it over with. everything was either entirely predictable or completely illogical. floating frozen clouds? seriously? the least they could do was have tinkerbell fly onto the set and explain how that could happen. i guess because cameron got away with nicking roger deans floating mountains in avatar nolan thought no one would complain. but lets face it avatar wasnt exactly trying to be clever and thats where this goes over the line. if youre going to delve into the big questions like quantum mechanics relativity and black holes you set yourself up to be measured by a whole new set of rules. nobody complains about harry potter flying on a broomstick but have him try and explain it using einstein and youre going to be in a mess of trouble. as for the reviews comparing it to 2001 the only things it has that are the same is that it is set in space and there is a wormhole. absolutely nothing else is the same and frankly it is an insult to compare this to kubricks masterpiece. and when people say get over it its just a movie theyre rewarding someone for being lazy. just like gravity this had all the elements to be a masterpiece if theyd just bothered to talk to a few more people in the science community besides kip thorne who apparently understands the workings of the universe all except for the black hole which is hollywood.,30
2019.11.09,10,during the emergency docking scene i said to myself this movie is perfect. i couldnt fund a flaw. the story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. there is a gravity to their work and they each show it well. my favorite genre us sci fi. this is plausible scifi which is my favorite subset of scifi. mcconnahey is amazing as usual. the young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again. the music is so good im learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site. ive seen interstellar 7 or 8 times. ill watch it regularly for years to come. its a classic of our time much like inglorious basterds.,12
2024.08.14,10,an unmissable date for any science fiction fan. nolan reaches limits rarely seen and is on par with kubrick or andrei tarkovski in terms of his representation. matthew mcconaughey is incredible and it may be one of the few nolan films where there are strong female characters who make themselves known. it is a visual and sound journey because yes the soundtrack is one of the best we can see from hans zimmer and i think that says a lot. the level that nolan reaches to get to this point is incredible how everything is there the scientific it is plausible it is credible. although sometimes he may be arrogant and intellectual i do not consider that he is making fun of the fans it is all there all the time. it convinces me from beginning to end and despite its length i would watch it a thousand times.,7
2022.06.29,10,i love this dream movie so much. i have never seen a better movie than this one. a fantastic dream realized. the music was outstanding and the acting and directing were tremendous. this fantastic film should be seen by everyone!,5
2014.11.05,10,interstellar takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable earth already at the brink of total destruction. earth and its resources is down to its last few moments but when a wormhole a medium that enables space timetravel beyond known limits is discovered scientists and ordinary men gather together to begin an exploration that would take timetraveling through different worlds in mans desperate search for humanitys place among the stars. to fully understand interstellar its premise and its accuracy may require repetitive thinking research and a certain level of intellectperhaps the same level nolan asked in inception. but the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it instead it begs you to feel it to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanitys last possible moments and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. nolans made sure that even the films ideas are too farfetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionallycharged tales of human relationships tangible enough to be felt and experienced. at its core is retired nasa engineer cooper mcconaughey and his relationship with his childrenmost strikingly with his daughter murph. coopers emotional journeythe decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planetalone serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from earth right from the moment the spacecract endurance takes off from the ground to the unknown limits of the cosmos. mcconaughey delivers a stunning and highlycommendable performance and while i cant say its his best as ive managed to have seen only a few of his movies i can certainly say its one of the best ive seen from any actor so far and he may be owing that to nolans impeccable direction. mcconaugheys incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. there are plenty of nailbiting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take and in each one he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver. nolans mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the films characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable hans zimmer. added with breathtaking cinematography and spectacular visual effects together these elements make interstellar capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. nolans managed to tread through the films seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the films aspects bonded together love. as chich as it may sound that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. there are a lot of questions raised and each one poses another but none of which really requires immediate answer and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand interstellar and have its questions answered in a way that doesnt necessarily oblige us to just think but also to make our emotions work as well so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through. sure it cant be perfect i myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative this either because i find it hard to solve nolans puzzlelike construction of the storylolor the narrative s really not just that good. if you have seen memento and inception the construction here is somehow similar as those two and some respected critics even argue this one cant be nolans best and i havent seen all his works yet either but for me it really isnt that hard to put this on the list of the best scifi movies ive seen so far. nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors whose powerful performances imo are enough to cover the flaws. not a single bit of every actors potential is put into waste here everyone has a star to shine in this universe nolan created. hans zimmers music seems to never go out of sync in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. visual effects is never less than topnotch the imagery presented in this film is utterly jawdropping so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. all those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive. interstellar is a thoughtprovoking and mindenriching motion picture a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions one of the best of its genre in a very long time. if this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades that definitely isnt going to come out as a surprise. this christopher nolan film deserves my 10 stars. ,25
2014.11.05,10,ok ive just seen interstellar and i can tell its one of those movies that you either love or hate. personally i loved it and probably im going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. its not a simple movie maybe that was already clear is a nolans film. matthew mcconaughey does a great job by portraying cooper. the most touching scenes are those between his character and mackenzie foy who plays the younger version of murph jessica chastain character. either it seems to be an outer space film is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others.  even its a long movie 169 minutes i didnt felt it that long or tedious. the director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film.  the experience on imax in 70mm film. the image quality perceived was superb now i get why christopher nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive.  i had the opportunity to watch it at the chinese theatre and was a great experience my first time in that theatre. the staff from the theatre even told us that nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to calibrate the experience. which is very cool.  well i encourage you to go and watch interstellar to see of you love or hate it.,14
2014.12.01,9,just watched this on imax with my movie theatreworking friend who had seen this before. it has matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. christopher nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on mcconaugheys offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. i have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. so on that note interstellar is very much worth seeing if youre patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.,5
2014.11.07,6,interstellar was an above average film and i have no regrets spending a friday night checking it out. unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they dont analyze it too deeply. however if you are one who understands the world of physics aviation or space travel this one is hard to watch. there are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. it seems like chris nolan watched gravity and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. he added the contact premise and inserted some physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. i was hopeful that i would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but i wasnt. the guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. of our group there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up.,9
2014.11.09,10,i just returned after seeing interstellar again 2nd time and i can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. im trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film.  first id like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line  nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. it slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. it will keep you on the edge of your sit  literally  it will make you cry it will make you jump it will completely absorb you. throughout the course of it i forgot i was in a cinema. i was living every single moment with the characters feeling what theyre feeling. at times i found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity  how can this be? is this really happening? can it be so epic?  the second time i saw it i understood the importance of every single scene and line i saw more connection more intricacy and even more genius in it. the first time it was grand and overwhelming it just hit me hard and i couldnt really pay attention to details.  the emotional journey part was very important to me but of course there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there into the action. they were fantastic superb simply put filmmaking at its finest. this is all of course from my point of view  a super scifi fantasy adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. although i cannot imagine how one regardless of their movie preferences can dislike interstellar  its that good. what im obviously saying is go see this movie. expect epicness. it will not disappoint.,19
2014.11.09,6,i wont give it a 1 to even things up a little i give it a 6 which is real. maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. im disappointed with a film that i waited for so long with a great title that was waisted. interstellar should have been a masterpiece with well a lot of interstellar traveling. the duration is just to long especially the first part which brings nothing extra to the story. its just to stretched out trying to bring i dont know what. a feel of 2001 maybe but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. i didnt like inception either so maybe it has got to be something with nolan. im a scifi fan but today everyones trying to make scifi but they dont succeed. they are doing it wrong! district 9 was the last good scifi i watched. interstellar has got great visuals i give it that but gravity had more another film that sucked big time. i wouldnt watch it again.,14
2014.11.21,2,ok ill keep this brief but ill also nail my credentials to the mast first. i know science cosmology scifi and filmmaking pretty well. i have in the past taught film studies at degree level and worked on the production of more than one major hollywood scifi film. i read stephen baxter and i like space stuff a lot. more than a lot. and why am i telling you this? because i should have loved interstellar but i didnt for one simple reason it is a truly dreadful piece of filmmaking. i wont even bother with dissecting the science in the film because that isnt really the issue it is wrong on pretty much every level. im not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. and ill ignore the substandard special effects  because fx dont a great movie make. the issues i have with interstellar are essentially these the film is an arsenumbing three hours long and feels far longer. the pace is stunningly poorly judged  the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost. the characters are paperthin and i didnt care about any of them. the plot is entirely derivative mostly of the vastly superior contact. the special effects arent special at all and the editing or lack of is so selfindulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. the result is a plodding flabby and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact. i wont go on but special mention must be made of the planets  paddling world and coldworld. you see virtually nothing of either and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor cgi painfully inferior to a perfect storm and a location less dramatic than your own back garden. ive probably not been a brief as i intended but as i write this i feel the disappointment and actual anger i felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. it was a total letdown and a waste of more than three hours of my life. the gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd and i am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. i am fairly confident i didnt doze off although i desperately wanted to. so in conclusion contact did all of this far far better fifteen years ago. in contact the characters are human believable beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. the relationship between father and daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. but then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extraterrestrial life the science is accurate and entirely plausible it was written by carl sagan after all the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle and it has something very profound to say. contact is everything interstellar is not and it has a considerably shorter running time. contact brought tears to my eyes interstellar bored me to tears.,28
2014.11.08,10,what an incredible film a mesmerizing ride from minute 1 to minute 169. i couldnt believe when it ended that it was already finished time appeared to go away quickly when watching this in the theater and remember when it ended i wished there was more of this epic movie. great directing great performances the effectssets could have been better i like my detail which unfortunately some sceneseffects lacked and you got to take a big leap of faith to ignore the obvious paradox. if you do the latter you will enjoy a nolans masterpiece. one of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best scifi i have ever watched.,5
2014.11.12,10,i have never in my life experienced such an emotional brake as i did today watching interstellar! i left theatre shaking violently crying and having i think 150 bpm. every single piece of the movie from the story itself visuals music and acting is a perfect combination and perfection. i even cant find right word to give you proper review partly because english is not my nativeand summarization wont give the movie justice. the only thing i regret that i watched it dubbed though in my country dubbing is really good i advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as i did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey! p.s. oscars to nolan and the movie right away!,8
2014.11.13,10,the sixth sense meets inception. makes you cry sweat and question your own actions in the face of these scenarios if you approach the film wholeheartedly and ready for the ride then it will take you on quite a journey and youll only want to see it again and again. the music really does the job of keeping you suspended anne hathaway and jessica chastain do fine work as does matthew mcconaughey and the little girl playing a younger jessica chastain pulls at your heartstrings. i was really really pleased with this and wish it was getting as much attention and praise as it deserves i think the writing was genius and it really had my brain working hard. you walk out of the theater and everyone around you is talking about it from the sidewalk to the subway ride home everyone it was really funny to see.,5
2014.11.07,10,a quantum leap in film making. the greatest story ever told. a movie that encompasses all that is and can be human. interstellar bravely transcends into the unknown throughout time and space leaving no one behind.  my persistent craving for unwavering diligence in directing and acting has been satisfied with ample sufficiency. very few take true pride in what they do and most never try. but to never give up hope and to reach for the stars is how real greatness is achieved. thank you mr. nolans thank you cooper for creating a piece that holds such faith in mankinds will to survive and most of all love. 5d 1010,10
2015.04.19,9,well to me this was one of the better sciencefiction movies that i ever saw. its been a long time since i didnt see a scifi like this one. its extremely long but you wont get bored for a second. and that says enough about it. all the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. the story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions black holes or wormholes. you have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like i said before with interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. i was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. one of the better movies i watched this year and certainly the best scifi in years.,9
2014.11.08,10,badass... is the adjective which i choose to type the first word of this review. as i left the theater i was not only spellbound but i was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended. the movie has a slow pace at the beginning but not really boring. steady and unique in its nature i did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster gravity starring sandra bullock and george clooney. with every minute that passed i could feel the importance of time which let my prejudice drain away. with twists and turns but not brainspraining at all it did make emotions come at par with adventure. great acting by matthew mcconaughey did overshadow anne hathaway. with an epic storyline and nolans direction space galaxy and the universe did reach a whole new level. i would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. this movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or tv. its buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious touching heartwarming adventurous science fiction and oscar deserving movies of all time. hats off to both the nolans!,13
2014.11.14,7,even though im a big fan of christofer nolan i find this movie pretty boring. respect for tackling such a complex subject and for making generally smart blockbusters. unfortunately movie is a big mess. wrong pace melodramatic acting terrible music and mumbling imabadasscowboy matthew mcconaughey speech just didnt work for me. one of the most miscast movies i have ever seen. im familiar with solaris and 2001 odyssey but this one just didnt work for me. i gave it 7 after all since i dont think movie is terrible i just think its not great and people got brainwashed by marketing tools into loving this film and giving it such high grade.,7
2022.11.23,8,having destroyed all resources on the planet like a rapacious insatiable gannet its time to move on to vacate and be gone find a new place to rampage and beset. but where can you take all the people to build their new churches and steeples and how to get there if you can find somewhere without a breakthrough in science and maths rules. juxtaposing a more than probabilistic forecast of things to come with the absurd to produce a wholly engaging and imaginative piece of scifi that may well get you thinking of what might just happen to the planet and the people of it when the help and support of as yet undiscovered dimensions fails to materialise. great performances great effects leaves you wanting to revisit 2001 a space odyssey but you know youll never know why.,4
2014.11.08,6,the movie is incredibly beautiful but it is not intelligent but is mostly a strange mix that does not quite know what it wants. i like it when science and technology are described believable which at times is the case here but just as in the masterpiece in 2001 it falls hard when you mix in philosophy with a high level of abstraction. of course there are more holes in the script than can be listed here. one obvious to me is that if the descendants of humanity are those that make us survive who was it that saved us the first time? we meet several parallel stories and my 14 year old daughter even shed a tear over something she could not quite explain afterwards. we meet the stories about how humans devastated the earths resources technophobia and heroes immortality. the only person who seems quite realistic however matt daemon. its like his mixture of malice selfishness and cowardice doing so the movie gets off the ground for a short while. and it is of course not good for a film largely set in space pun intended.,9
2014.11.06,4,interstellar is mediocre. the story is chock full of cheap clichs love is the 5th dimension! overlayered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained. the movie makes sense until matt damon. up to that point the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up more or less. although if you know youre going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet why leave that one poor guy on his own? its kind of heartless and thats when i started doubting the movie. but ok fine. i can live with that. then they head for the ice planet. and all of a sudden gravity is the force that transcends time and your mind fights death so you can see your children. all downhill from there way into deep space 9. the movie takes a turn for the worse a nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. its endearing but incomprehensible. granted the movies pretty. so i gave it two stars. the actors? love all of them. thats another 2. but i simply cannot live with a script thats nonsensical and full of stuff were supposed to take at facevalue because its christopher nolan and hes an otherwise brilliant director what was michael caine trying to not solve? what is all the research about? and scifi directors please drop the blackboard and chalk clich. we technology people use computers now. blackboards were useful when newton was running things. now? not so much. it sounded like but im not really sure the five dimension bookcase which lost me completely was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. but then i also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. then why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? why not just send an email with the data component thats missing? why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? and how is that future humanity saved anyway? and how does the robot whose location in space is never explained come in possession of that data? and do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? going back to the michael caine thing whats the precious data component that he was missing? what does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones. and how does humanity get saved? do they invent some sort of galactic noahs ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that earth has become? could they not do that before? im sure they could. how does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? or maybe thats not what happened. im just not sure.  the list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodgepodge of pseudophilosophicalpseudoscientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. its intended for 1 scifi dorks who tend to not overthink things 2 nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny 3 movie buffs who enjoyed cloud atlas which was more boring and more bizarre than interstellar but only slightly.,47
2025.04.18,8,i dont watch movies very often im not a film critic and i dont really know much about movies. but i liked this movie. i had the opportunity to watch it earlier at an earlier age at that time it seemed that its an ordinary movie. now that ive watched it again i realize that its not a movie. its a masterpiece. i wont talk about the plot ill just insist that you watch it. thank you for your attention. i still need to write 150 characters to publish so the score will go from 90 to 0 90 89 88 87 86 85 84 83 82 81 80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0.,8
2024.12.14,10,interstellar is and always was one of my personal favorite films of all time. i first experienced the film in imax when it was released in 2014 and ive been a devoted admirer ever since. but this week i was fortunate enough to be in new york precisely when the film was being rescreened in imax  and not just any imax but in the grandeur of imax 70mm  as part of the 10thanniversary celebrations of its release. despite having seen the film several times before rewatching it multiple times to mark its decadelong impact in the magnificent imax theaters of the u. s. stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences weve had in our lives. no matter how many times i watch the film it always excites me intrigues me and also brings me to tears. a unique cinematic experience like no other that pushes the boundaries of cinema and how science can be depicted in film. the collaborative process between christopher nolan and his brother jonathan known for memento the prestige the dark knight and westworld among other works in crafting the screenplay united two brilliant but slightly different minds. this dynamic provided the creative friction that birthed such an extraordinary story. in the early stages jonathan was the principal screenwriter entrusted with the task of shaping the script. he worked on the project for several years alongside producer lynda obst and theoretical physicist kip thorne. the original draft was heavily centered on the intricate scientific principles underpinning the plot such as einsteins theory of relativity and in particular the concept of time dilation. when christopher came on board as director he reworked the script to emphasize the emotional and philosophical dimensions of the story. this shift  from a strict focus on science to one that balanced scientific rigor with emotional storytelling  became one of the defining aspects that granted the film its unparalleled strength. it is ultimately this synthesis of emotional depth with scientific exploration that elevates interstellar to a truly extraordinary work within the scifi genre. the scriptwriting process between the brothers included a continuous exchange of ideas at every stage of its development. christophers inclination toward emotional storytelling intertwined with jonathans passion for scientific precision and narrative complexity. as the films director christopher also had the responsibility of translating jonathans abstract scientific concepts into compelling visually stunning cinematic moments and images. this process enabled audiences to grasp abstract and extremely complicated scientific ideas through groundbreaking visual storytelling. its incredible to witness how with the passage of time interstellar is increasingly recognized not only as a monumental chapter in nolans legendary filmography but also as a bona fide classic in the scifi genre. with the nolans now receiving the broader recognition they deserve from the global film and television community not just their core fanbase more and more people now grasp the thematic essence the nolans were striving for with the unique storytelling elements they insisted on including in interstellar. one of the most unique characteristics of nolan as a filmmaker is his profound love and respect for science as well as his understanding of its importance in both storytelling and realworld impact. this is reflected in the themes he chooses to explore the logical framework behind his scripts and the technical aspects of his filmmaking process. from project to project he constantly experiments with new techniques that push the boundaries of film industry technology. he strives to maintain scientific accuracy in his narratives as much as possible while telling captivating stories that highlight the vital role of scientists and the value of intellect in the modern era. contrary to the common criticism that nolans films often sideline female characters interstellar features a significant and very welcome representation of strong influential women in the field of science. jessica chastain and anne hathaway deliver compelling and charismatic performances taking center stage in the films unfolding events and playing a crucial role in the storys progression. mackenzie foy also impresses in a onceinalifetime performance of a curious intelligent and ambitious child that doesnt shy from the performances of other veteran actors and actresses in the film with a role that will surely inspire future generations of young viewers. if we delve further into the unique collaborations behind the making of interstellar and to the films unique property of depicting science in the most accurate way possible the extraordinary partnership between christopher nolan and theoretical physicist kip thorne stands out as one of the films most intriguing aspects. this collaboration was paradigmshifting in its own right as it sought to depict einsteins theory of relativity as accurately as possible on screen. instead of resorting to clichs or convenient narrative shortcuts thorne a nobel prizewinning theoretical physicist acted as both scientific consultant and producer of the film. his primary role was to ensure that depictions of black holes wormholes and the effects of relativity on time dilation were as scientifically accurate as possible. maintaining scientific precision required a delicate balance between creative cinematic storytelling and the constraints of established physics. while nolan known for his narrative complexity and visual ambition occasionally sought to introduce elements that bent the rules of physics thorne firmly insisted on absolute scientific accuracy. this principle of realism shaped not only the depiction of time dilation but also the emotional and philosophical core of the film where time itself becomes a central emotionally charged narrative device. their collaboration continues to set a gold standard for how science can be faithfully integrated into cinematic storytelling. after watching the film in an imax theater in the u. s. this week i noticed a group of young students from a school or some sort of academic club attending the screening. they even took a group photo afterward to commemorate the experience. if that doesnt highlight nolans influence in inspiring future generations of innovators and scientists we dont know what does. of course no discussion of interstellar would be complete without mentioning hans zimmers phenomenal score which the legendary composer himself has referred to as his most cherished soundtrack in his extensive career. the process of collaboration between zimmer and nolan was unconventional and experimental compared to their previous collaborations. instead of supplying zimmer with a script or a detailed plot outline nolan wrote him a onepage letter describing the films central emotional core  the relationship between a father and his daughter  and asked him to compose from that emotional premise alone. without knowing that it was a scifi epic zimmer crafted an intimate and deeply moving score built around a church organ capturing the emotional anchor of the story. this approach yielded a score that felt personal and evocative rather than tethered to the spectacle typically associated with the scifi genre. the two also chose to emphasized the use of a church organ to evoke a sense of cosmic awe and spiritual transcendence. ultimately the focus on emotional authenticity rather than bombastic spectacle produced a soundtrack that has become one of zimmers most celebrated works earning critical acclaim and nominations for the academy award and the grammy. in a typical fashion to zimmers groundbreaking works interstellar did not initially receive the recognition it deserved from major award bodies like the oscars or the golden globes. but history tends to favor the enduring and today the interstellar soundtrack is regarded as one of the most powerful and timeless film scores ever created. the raw emotional resonance it evokes during the film and even while listening to it completely outside of watching the film is nothing short of extraordinary. even generally speaking looking back at the awards season following the films release the academys reluctance to recognize interstellar and nolans achievements while creating the film remains truly baffling. nolan did not receive nominations for best director or best original screenplay decisions that now seem glaringly questionable in hindsight. particularly when compared to certain contemporaneous winners like alfonso cuarns gravity which interstellar in comparison stands head and shoulders above in ambition visual storytelling and philosophical depth in our opinion. with nolans triumphant sweep during awards season for oppenheimer one can only hope that the academy will in the future be more open to recognizing his contributions to the scifi genre which has long been overlooked at such ceremonies. what might have been an open question 10 years ago is now clear interstellar has cemented its place in the annals of cinematic history as one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time. its scientific precision gripping narrative breathtaking visuals extraordinary performances masterful soundtrack and impeccable execution on all fronts have earned it a rightful place as one of the most iconic films to ever grace the silver screen. and above all its a whole lot of fun.,59
2024.12.13,10,this has been one of my favorite movies ever since it was released in 2014. ive watched it countless times and nolan is by far my favorite director but i had never seen any of his films besides oppenheimer in imax... until last night. i was fortunate to catch the 10 year anniversary showing of interstellar in imax and was absolutely blown away. the fact that i was on the edge of my seat for a movie i know so much about is a testament to how powerful this movie is. the score is the best in any film and the space visuals are simply stunning. the film flew by and i left the theatre with my mind blown even more than i could have anticipated. i plan to always see this movie whenever it is shown and truly believe everyone needs to experience it the way nolan intended. 100010... simply the greatest film ive ever seen on screen.,10
2023.07.08,8,i havent seen the film since it came out in 2014. my teenage self found it slow confusing and tiresome. but now im 2023 i decided to give it a rewatch solely because i constantly listen to the score. so what did i think? i am pleasantly surprised how much i enjoyed the film. the film has so much heart for a scfi movie that it took me off guard. at its core its about a father wanting to reuniteprotect his child. the story was interesting the ending mightve been a bit too optimistic and rushed but it felt satisfying to me as a viewer. the cinematography music acting sound design set dressing everything was amazing. yes there were points where i was thankful i had subtitles on. seeing topher grace was also a bit odd since only associating him with that 70s show and venom. the visuals for the space scenes were astonishing. truly a feat of cgi and technological advances. overall there are more positives than negatives for the film. it was a great watch the emotional beats landed for me the betrayals were impactful and it left me thinking more about this potential scenario.,15
2025.10.27,10,a total masterpiece from the beginning to the end. so clever so educative so good acting i dont think i ve ever watched a better movie in my life. its from the movies that sticks in your mind and change your way of thinking. i dont have to say anything negative about it. a 3 hour movie that you can not take your eyes off of it.,5
2024.12.11,10,the best movie of its decade. interstellar is christopher nolans finest film to date. interstellar is ambitious and riveting from start to finish a film that never fails to grasp your attention during its threehour run time. with dazzling visuals and a gooey yet strong emotional core thats truly affecting its one of the best movies ive seen all year. interstellar is a science fiction film that explores the themes of love sacrifice and humanitys place in the universe. the film follows a former nasa pilot who is recruited to pilot a dangerous mission through a newly discovered wormhole in search of habitable planets for humanity to colonize.,6
2015.11.03,7,was this movie terrible? no but for as much praise as it got im astounded. the plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. that isnt what killed the movie however it was the acting! maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way but every time they did something amazing they barely acted surprised. it was as if it was all in a days work. this is the sole reason why i cant get myself to re watch this movie. the visuals were amazing but im more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects call me old school even though im in my 20s. the movie tries to be like 2001 a space odyssey but falls short. 2 months after watching interstellar not much is retained in my memory i had to reread the ridiculous plot and rewatch a trailer to bring my memory back. whereas 2001 i watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it.  it may seem like im calling this movie terrible its not. its just highly overrated and i need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. maybe ive seen too many programs about space cosmos the universe 2001 etc that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals but if youre a person that has not seen too many space programs youd probably like it.  and just an fyi this is coming from a guy that hated gravity and inception. if you like those you may like this movie.,16
2024.12.09,10,interstellar 2014 directed by christopher nolan is a visually stunning and emotionally charged scifi epic. the film explores love sacrifice and humanitys quest for survival as a group of astronauts travel through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. with breathtaking visuals a hauntingly beautiful score by hans zimmer and strong performances particularly from matthew mcconaughey the film blends science and emotion. while some plot elements may feel complex its ambition and thematic depth make it a thoughtprovoking cinematic experience. overall the one thing missing about this movie is that it doesnt have part 2.,5
2014.11.20,6,a long tedious movie. it attempts to be an epic but fails. it attempts to say something profound but the message is garbled. the movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudoscientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. the movie contains elements from 2001 a space odyssey and the matrix with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extradimensionality all pure hollywood. matthew mcconaughey is the principal actor his character cooper is the central figure of the story the rest of the cast are supporting characters their placement in the credits notwithstanding. mcconaughey gives an interesting performance which includes several scenes in which he weeps which for a leading man is remarkable. the depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets halfbaked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. being a sciencefiction movie stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense e.g acceleration of time relationship of time to gravity time as a material object. this movie is proof that when hollywood attempts to deal with time warps time holes multidimensionality relativity and other complex scientific theories the results can be less than optimum.,11
2015.04.20,3,a lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. films based in history biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. directorsproducers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. as follows 1. blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just cant happen the way depicted. 2. dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. besides crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels but no solar panels visible. propulsion was? 4. the pulp fiction fable of no apollononmoon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. mcconaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. communicating in barcode or morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. and later the gravityquantum equations coming from the future in morse which doesnt have calc encodings. certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. female role model in hathaway was cast for smilelooks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. dad dr. brand also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution  that sounded really ridiculous. 11. looking for new earth in another galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. the energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our suns output for a thousand years. also if you can place it next to saturn then why not closer like next to mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. the wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. communicating through a wormhole. whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. speaking of mars it can be terraformed with a few hbombs to release co2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give h20 thus oxygen. 15. turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. centrifuge center had a saturn type rocket 100m high which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. in reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. and why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? surely they must have at least an ipad! 19. so not explained was how love brought cooper through multiple dimensions possibly universes to the exact correct time  space that murph happened to occupy. probably because the writer couldnt. 20. tars sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage let alone running. 21. the films ending of throwing papers the eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical hollywoodish. 22. ranger view of earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover normal water and land color. 23. five dimensional spacetime is decades oldhat. seven nine and for the past dozen years eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. remember thats all this is  a construct. 24. the effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. the interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech such as lap tops all simultaneous with space vehicles  stations not yet achievable for several more decades didnt make sense  incongruous. 26. the alternate earth being made habitable by altering some madeup chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to n2 didnt make planetary chemistry sense especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets also most likely more than a 100 degrees below zero. conclusion so many holes in this film that only a worm would love.,71
2014.11.08,10,every generation of movie goers sees one film maybe two that changes the game for them. it becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. they remember where they saw it who they saw it with even where they were sitting. christopher nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film interstellar. i feel i cant even call going to see a nolan piece a movie but more like an event. for the average movie goer they most likely arent familiar with the directors of the films theyre seeing but most know nolan. most know of nolan because he has made some of the biggest thrilling and thought provoking films of the past decade from the dark knight trilogy to inception. its almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of interstellar because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because i know that i will leave out something big. anyway the film takes place in a potentially nottoodistant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. in comes an engineerpilotfather cooper matthew mcconaughey who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come. mcconaughey has always had that movie star potential and i think this is the film that puts him in that title. this was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and i honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. interstellar was originally supposed to be done by steven spielberg before he dropped out and nolan stepped in. nolan clearly influenced by past spielberg films like close encounters of the third kind and jaws puts mcconaughey in a role in the same vein as richard dreyfuss in close encounters or roy schneider in jaws. they needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and mcconaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything including his family whom he knows he may not see again and try to save the human race. you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. this isnt necessarily a role that wins oscars but it should be. the effects are obviously amazing. this much like gravity last year is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen especially in imax. this along with the haunting score of frequent nolan collaborator hans zimmer almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. kind of piggy backing off of that point there will be those who will trash the film for the science isnt accurate. those comments are nonsense because no matter what science tells us there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. could we really transcend time and space? would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? impossible for us to say at this point but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of what can be. its the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like interstellar in a time where there are no more explorers were fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds. people will remember interstellar for either being a truly great film experience or not as good as 2001 a space odyssey. this is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to 2001 and defenders of the kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesnt live up to it. this is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. people see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later rivaling the one they saw. people want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. i respect and detest this because i will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as interstellar come out and i fear it is something that is out of my control. much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. the connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility. in the end interstellar is one of those landmark films. its a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure hope and amazement that rarely comes around. dont miss it.,38
2023.01.12,10,before i watch this movie i knew that it was very high rated also ive seen some spoilers and i thought it wouldnt be good as i expected but when i saw i forget everything it was just amazing it was the perfect combination of visual effects incredible music story and unforgettable performance i love this movie its just a masterpiece. weve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. and we count these moments. these moments when we dare to aim higher to break barriers to reach for the stars to make the unknown known. we count these moments as our proudest achievements. thanks to christopher nolan.,6
2022.07.04,10,just an outstanding performance by matthew and just a great directing job. the film story is out of this world an if you love the universe like i do its the perfect movie for you.,2
2021.11.18,10,incredible story full of emotion with suspense and great acting...i watched this movie more than 5 time and its the best sf movie i ve ever seen! its not possible. no its necessary.,4
2022.12.11,10,i watched this when it first came out and i recently just re watched it it never gets old. best movie out there. nothing is better than your first time watching this movie because it will blow you mind. one is the reasons this movie is loved so much is because of the highly scientific accuracy i honestly cannot express how amazing this movie is and how beloved it is to me. the movie is completely mind boggling and i love it so much. everything was great the plot was 1010 pacing was 8.910 cinematography was 1110 acting was 1010 so overall 1010. definitely recommend and your movie standards will definitely change after watching!,8
2023.04.22,10,i watched this movie for the first time when i was twelve and i have to say very very few maybe none movies can even be compared to interstellar. its not just a scifi movie its an experience an emotion. it stays with you it lingers it gets into your head and heart and takes over your consciousness. its a masterpiece. you will not be the same after you finish watching this. the visuals the acting the story the soundtrack...everything about this movie is exemplary. its been 9 years and this movie never fails to amaze me and i keep coming back to watch it again and again and again. quite possibly the best movie ever created.,9
2014.11.07,7,interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of christopher nolan he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of memento and insomnia to striking gold in the enormously popular dark knight franchise. inception was proof nolan could successfully tackle a big budget original idea outside of the batman series but with comic book films behind him interstellar has to sell on the promise that nolan is not a onehit wonder of bigbudget original ideas. the movies plot focuses on cooper a southerner and family man who doesnt quite understand why man is turning away from flight. we used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars he says now we just look at the ground and see dirt. matthew mccoughaney shines in the role of cooper delivering one of his careerbest. cooper is an everyman and nothing in this world or any other is more important to him than his kids in particular his daughter murphy played spectacularly by mackenzie foy. despite great performances from a huge ensemble beautiful visuals and setting shot by first time nolan cinematographer hoyte van hoytema let the right one in interstellar features a typical problem in every nolan movie too much expository dialogue. it is very obvious in numerous moments that nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. my other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. thought the movie establishes the world and doesnt rush to do so the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. from the first act it is unclear whether interstellar can deliver.  its in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. much of the film from this point on is set in space and boasts mindbending special effects as timeless as 2001 a space odyssey. the movie features some strikingly similar shots clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. a lot of the shots are wonderful and interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films sorry wally pfister but a few times i found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship endurance. interstellar reaches for the stars but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land. in addition to great visuals the sound design and score are topnotch. hans zimmer does some of his best work bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space while hitting all the right emotional notes. and the movie knows when to be quiet in space not just outside the ship but inside. i loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers the slight creaking of the ship the breath of the characters. the attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real. when the plot does finally introduce a villain in its second act the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed its welcome. interstellar runs at 169 minutes and its a long one admittedly. cooper and amelia played by a wellcast anne hathaway are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances and christopher nolan does not hold back. this makes for some heartstring tugging sequences and interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content but the acting is so good that it doesnt matter if its slightly overdone and it all builds it to a marvelous climax. interstellars third act is as stunning as anything ive ever seen in film. for critics who thought inception was proof that christopher nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign interstellar proves them wrong. thematically and scientifically the movie dares to challenge it dares its audience to follow into the unknown beyond the horizon. i am still trying to wrap my head around it all. nolans blockbuster epic is not perfect and its not for the common audience. if youre looking for big action sequences or looking to turn your brain off for awhile youre in the wrong movie. its got some bumps along the way but interstellar is visionary for our time and so bold in its execution that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. i was thrilled to take the ride. interstellar is thoughtprovoking emotional cinematic and a wonder to behold which in time should earn its title in the league of great science fiction. grade a,35
2023.11.07,10,for a scifi geek and a problem solving brain love does not count for much in your average day by day. but boy oh boy this one hits you in the feels you didnt know you had. this move is like an eminem song. it has everything. love for fame for science for your fellow humans for mother father and children for your dead ones for the unborned ones. you name it. this move reconciles the working class with the intelectualelite class and puts them in the same level of importance. i have never seen a portrayal of this so balanced. its the first exploration of the universe as a physical need and not as a curiosity. this movie has so many nuances and perspectives that a narrow mind like mine cannot explain them accurately. ill stop here. just watch it.,12
2014.11.07,6,let me bring you this in overview.  pro  stunning visually through and through  good acting by the entire cast  interesting concept  a strong second half  a somewhat satisfying ending  a few interesting twists  the main musical theme is amazing.  con  it took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. it had a few good moments but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. if it hadnt been a nolan movie i would probably have left in the break. im glad i didnt. but the first half makes me not want to see this movie again.  there are really too many plot holes. or moments that are not wellexplained enough for them to be plausible. things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well pretty much nothing. especially near the end. which doesnt take away from the awesomeness of the second half. but one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story.  besides the main theme most of the score seem misplaced. too loud. too bombastic. or not adding to the emotions on screen. and im speaking as a huge hans zimmer fan here. all in all i would recommend seeing it. definitely. but with an expectation that its not as special as weve come to expect from nolan.,23
2014.12.05,3,memento and inception had some problems but their ideas stretched the imagination. interstellar only delivers the vacuous pretension one would expect if a batman director thought he could eclipse kubricks 2001 with an implausible adventure story. christopher nolans new film begins inauspiciously and steadily declines as its longwinded prologue introduces the hollywoodian elements of a steven spielbergnorman rockwell scifi coproduction  a widowed exastronaut farmer his chiseled jaw a feisty daughter a crusty grandpa baseball dust storms a dying earth paranormal activity cornfields  and lots of corn. after about an hour  which seems like two  a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. once theyve journeyed through an interstellar wormhole the farfetched nature of the tale expands to cosmic levels. nolans need to overwhelm his audience with awesomeness is so powerful that he forgets to tell a believable story. scientific hocuspocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis frozen planets deranged scientists spaceship chases time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy hallmarklevel climax. the visual effects are above average but diminished by the cheesy melodrama of the narrative. when all the films sturm und drang has died away selfimportance and mawkishness are the abiding impressions.,9
2022.05.25,10,the images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by hans zimmer and his music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. and there it was.. the ending. i couldnt believe it . i was reliving rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment the smell of popcorn my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes.,7
2014.11.10,10,i saw this opening night thursday. i wanted the full monty. that means imax i drove across town to get it. wow! there are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go or more. the first was 2001 a space odyssey. star wars empire strikes back and avatar come to mind for now. this was such a spectacle with a very complex script ill admit i left the theater with a lot of questions. i knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience i just couldnt fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. i write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later no imax. omg! i loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. for me at least it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. this is a science fiction film for the ages!,14
2014.11.13,10,expect very much from the cast and director. and all expectations fulfilled. the film is almost 3 hours but they are not feeling. time flies by. no slack in the storyline. everywhere where there might be desired drool snot or lengthy disquisitions  all collected in a couple of phrases and capacious video sequences. nor any stupid nonsense about the bible and god. its scifi baby! after viewing the impression left is not even like the movie and how soundly from the book that you read with pleasure. lots of thoughts left to think. the film like a good book revealed to you something new along with the author allowed to dive into his world. world so close to ours. very suggest targeting the film for viewing. even if you do not like everything in the movie you will get acquainted with one of the best representatives of the genre on today date.,14
2024.08.16,10,i just rewatched interstellar and i can confidently say its one of the best movies ive ever seen in my entire life. the storyline is spoton and the visuals are absolutely mesmerizing. every time i hear hans zimmers interstellar theme it hits me right in the feels. the twists and theories in the movie are so thoughtprovoking they really make you ponder how the universe works. its one of those films that sticks with you long after the credits roll. i think many of us can agree that interstellar is a true masterpiece. i hope well be lucky enough to experience another masterpiece like this in the future. movies like interstellar is rare it sure leave a lasting impression. if you havent seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch iti guarantee you wont be disappointed.,9
2024.05.14,10,interstellar is an amazing movie all around. the casting is good. matthew mcconaughey was amazingly well in this movie. really his performance showed what his career has worked up to be. astonishing. i also would like to point out that the sound of being in space felt real life. the sound of nothing. the sound of movement with hydrogen and helium. space air the different emotions i felt watching this movie was mind blowing. this movie had my attention the whole 2h 49m i believe this is truly a 10 out of 10 movie. i feel that watching this movie has gave me a new perspective on how much work is put into movies. everyone must watch. interstellar a work of art. al.,14
2024.08.15,10,i rewatched this movie after 10 years... initially seeing it in the cinemas when it released i realise i was too immature to watch it back then. after a decade i finally decided to watch this again. i cried my eyes out. a fully grown man crying like a child watching this thank god nobody was here to witness. i truly managed to grasp the beauty and emotion of this masterpiece after so long. i dont think i need to say much more i just wanted to write something after wiping all my tears. i wish i could go back in time to that moment as i am now and relive that experience of watching it all over again. exquisite. emotive. exceptional.,11
2014.11.05,7,just watched this in new zealand. the imdb rating is still above 9 at the time. not sure it will stay there though. its not a bad movie but its not a great one either which a 9 should be. its creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. it goes for the gravity look and feel being slow filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music but it does not have the suspense of gravity. its doesnt draw you in. it just doesnt have enough substance to carry it off. it has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate whats going on. its still worth watching at 710 just dont expect a 910.,10
2014.11.12,10,this film is just legendary i do not see why people are hating this film its unpredictable and well just plain brilliant. a lot of the science in this movie is true for a science fiction film. i believe this is nolans best yet and i believe that its probably the greatest film ever made. matthew deserves an oscar for his role no joke and hans zimmers soundtrack is a masterpiece in its own right completely new and different from his previous work check the dark knight trilogy and inception. the fx are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. the acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose. so overall to conclude this film is just mindblowing!,7
2014.11.13,6,there are moments during interstellar which may be compared to 2001 a space odyssey a better movie. there are moments during interstellar which may be compared to prometheus also a better movie. there are even moments and storytelling techniques within interstellar that are completely ripped off from inception a much better movie from christopher nolan himself. that said interstellar should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far and in the same breath should ultimately go down as one of director christopher nolans worst films to date. this highly anticipated nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms where the worlds food supply is nearly depleted or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted but that doesnt sound nearly as dire where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the apollo space missions were faked. during this time an underground government institution called nasa commissions a group of astronauts including matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway for a top secret space mission. this mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole with the promise of finding another inhabitable world. ok lets get right to it. any praise i heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film since the first 80 or so minutes of interstellar while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold is drenched in sequences of mcconaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious lincoln car ads caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth which nearly put me to sleep. in other words the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. anyway this is intersellars fatal flaw since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by nolan and his brother jonathan. even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the gravity of this plot begins to set in near the midpoint of act 2. final thoughtthe ending allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. during the final act of interstellar for most film nerds nolans story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of kubricks 2001 a space odyssey. some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. though this is not a huge issue since i dont believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales the problem is that for the millions who didnt see interstellar for any film school aesthetic reason nolans ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously farfetched that many may leave the theater angry that the punchline wasnt worth the nearly three hour set up.,16
2014.11.11,5,not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. not so the premise is exactly the same as his last move inception time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a blackhole. dont need to be a genius to understand that. secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of dazzling science fiction and an intimate human story. as for the human story its clunky and at times cringeworthy. its dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the nolan films. if you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch contact. as for the science fiction id have to say i was disappointed. parts were very spectacular but i was not impressed by the planet scenes. iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? i was somehow expecting more than this. overall grossly overrated by the critics yet go and see it all the same.,13
2014.11.12,9,interstellar 2014 12 matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway jessica chastain michael caine john lithgow ellen burstyn mackenzie foy matt damon casey affleck wes bentley david gyasi william devane leah cairns topher grace timothy chalamet brooke smith voice of bill irwin filmmaker christopher nolans valentine of sorts to 2001 a space odyssey and to his daughter continues his streak of audacious sense of space literally and the inner human spirit  set in the bleak future earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one hail mary of a plan by nasa  send a small crew thru a wormhole just go with it to see if they can help us. a grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of coolasacucumber and deeply felt performance by mcconaughey as the astronautpilot of the journey into the realms of desperation anchoring the film with a transfixing turn largely due to his interplay with young talented actress foy as his daughter  later played with cleareyed intensity by chastain no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to gravity for sheer amazement one must see it on a big screen and imax would be a start as it was filmed in the medium. hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad caine a nolan regular. the true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by hoyte van hoytema a stellar score by frequent collaborator hans zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. the only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the twilight zoneish final act makes up for it in spades. wow!,6
2014.11.04,9,went to see the film wednesday evening. overall it was an enjoyable film from start to finish with the help of humor along the way. excellent casting descent visuals and a good sound score. there were times i felt the music was overkill and would drown out certain scenes but overall well done. story meshed real well too and threw in a few curve balls. i would have liked to see some better visuals from space. especially when they arrived in the new solar system. been cool to have seen unique planets of different colors orbiting each other for instance. something unique to stamp the distance and uniqueness from our system. trivial but its those small things ,10
2014.11.05,8,this movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors. first it was thoughtprovoking. many questions were raised. what would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? what happens to government when we all have to live handtomouth? are they out there communicating with us? is it the essence of humanity to survive or is it to pioneer and by extension evolve? second it was also an adventure. i watched this in a full imax theater with eighty bajillion watts of super thunderround sound or whatever the kids call it now. the visual effects definitely shine on the imax screen. the format switches occasionally and usually imperceptibly between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue to imax format for that fullon dose of retinaoverload spectacle. this movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extragalactic world. there are also plenty of tense moments after which you realize youve been holding your breath. im glad i went to watch this. that said i think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis and also a multilayered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time gravity love and what it means to survive. it asks more questions than it explores. while it fills in for the missing answers with whiteknuckled brushes with death it wasnt as intellectually satisfying as i hoped. i spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. in the end we were grasping to find symbolism metaphors or other messages about humanity. we never coalesced the message of the movie. but did we need to? it was as i said also a thrill ride. the adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic i cant say i had the same postclimactic cathartic experience as ive had for other movies. but it was a definite end closing most of the open plot points. i certainly felt moved by the characters resolutions. i was suspicious that matthew mcconaughey could convince me that he was a spaceready engineer it turns out that he didnt need to because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. i think all the leads delivered solidly caine lithgow hathaway damon chastain affleck... i connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness. hans zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily i thought and unnecessarily. it wound up creating the opposite of the effect i think he intended. many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch musically. some of them worked brilliantly. although i had my quibbles the final analysis is that i would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time but im not making plans to for now.,33
2014.11.13,10,do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day. that was one hell of a dialog from the movie interstellar even though it was inspired from a poem.  chris nolan made a film which makes even science freaks also dont know some of em which he implied in the film. it is evidently clear that he doesnt like this 3d world which instead he created 5d world and made time as a physical quantity in his world. literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of chris. the way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste transcendence. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future. matt did a splendid job by portraying cooper and express his emotions as a destitute and griefstricken father was incomparable. hans zimmer he is at his best. anne and jess made justice to their roles. matt damon and michael caine played a pivotal role as well. chris also made india as part of his film because of m.o.m i think even though it is little about india i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a lilbit before bon appetite. remember do not go gentle into that good movie. interstellar and inception are the best scifi masterpieces ive ever seen in this decade. take a bow chris nolan and orgoglioso di es sere un fan di christopher nolan,18
2014.11.07,10,as a scifi fan who loves 2001 so contact gravity and many other movies that deal with with the topics also covered in interstellar i have to say i have no words to describe the movie. it just took me for one hell of a ride! the score provided by hans zimmer was an extraordinary piece of work. it fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the ost and not the other way around. there is an interview with christopher nolan in which he states that he wouldnt allow hans zimmer to know exactly what the movies plot device is he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between father and daughter. if this is the truth  wow! it worked flawlessly! i wont go and describe what i saw on the big screen because this is something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for himself... i can only tell you that after i saw the credits i attempted to get off my seat it didnt worked. i tried again pushing harder  it barely worked. moments after i was at the theaters exit heading out for the bus. i saw it coming just right on time with me but i didnt get on. i was compelled to walk and think. think of what i saw... my head was aching my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. i got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes. then i realized that i have also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... i was still in the movie i must definitely been because only there the time behaved the way i was feeling while coming home...,18
2014.11.12,10,i went to watch this film not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about. it started off well although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space. this does not effect the film though or my rating one bit as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary! the special effects in this film are awesome and are used in a way which i was literally at the edge of my seat in shear anticipation suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. its very tense in many parts and it certainly keeps you thinking. i dont know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star or say disappointing rubbish stick to batman nolan! these people dont know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! its a brilliant film something suitable for all the family! definitely a film for everyone one of the best movies ever!,9
2014.11.10,7,as directed by christopher nolan he of the pretentious derivative mindbending crapfest that was inception and the vastly overrated dark knight trilogy i fully expected interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station throughand with a whopping running time of 169 minutes i figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the films black hole which is actually called gargantuathats just how gargantuan it is!!!. sure enough the preposterous pseudoscientific plot can be picked apart with ease but the film itself is something of an anomaly although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point i found myself entertained throughout. interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of bigbudget baloney as a result. for starters we get matthew mcconaugheys farmer cooper who is chosen to pilot nasas only spacecraft despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. then we get two of sciencefictions most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of a.i. units tars and case. after flying through a wormhole cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. we see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. we have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting cooper with his space helmet. although michael caines character spans 23 years he doesnt look a day older than when we first see him his voice just gets a bit hoarse but not batman hoarse. and cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!! and thats just the stuff i can recall right now its waaay past my bedtime and im very tired. if only there had been a few ninjas some gratuitous female nudity perhaps a race of insatiable sexy alien maidens with oversized breasts a planet of space zombies and a laser battle this would have been the perfect sobaditsgood movie. 710 its too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as i really should.,15
2014.11.08,9,christopher nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey cowritten with his brother jonathan. this movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. the earth is chocking as it is a starving dirt bowl. the future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. coopermatthew mcconaugheyis a former test pilot and widower raising two children fifteen year old tomtimothee chalamet and ten year old murphmackenzie foy who is suspended from school for fighting. she refuses to believe the school books being right saying the apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt russias space program. cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct nasa where professor brandmichael caine convinces cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. the flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers who preceded them. a member of coopers mission is brands daughteranne hathaway. deep on the mind of coopers daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp. no little green men no aliens in sight. there are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots so to speak. visually awesome and enhanced by hans zimmers score. mcconaughey seems driven and invested. young miss foy is very watchable. and jessica chastain is excellent in the role of the adult murph. also in the cast john lithgow wes bently matt damon william devane casey affleck and ellen burstyn. plus the voices of bill irwin and josh stewart. interstellar is stellar!,19
2014.11.08,6,got to watch it on in imax format last night and found the imax experience disappointing still trying to understand if the effort to shoot in 70mm was worth it. same low def blurry type of delivery as watching gravity on a plane. mentioned gravity at the outset as it comes to mind more often while watching interstellar than kubricks 2001 i guess not what nolan brothers were shooting for... so a 2nd display of spinning debris in the cosmic emptiness in 12 months while trying to make this cinematically thrilling and engaging denotes some sort of gumption not that hollywood havent seen that kind of fx sequeling so many times. lets say that making movies in 2014 about stuff in space is not easy in a space where sound waves dont travel and silent movies are long extinct for a reason. interstellar however is not a very quiet movie at all lot of vibrating spacecraft and gripping soundtrack as fillers. kubrick got that right back in 68 using the blue danube to keep us connected to the scenes that everyone ever since used as textbook on any extraterrestrial imagery. nolan is telling a very simple story in a not very precise and confident rendering adding several disjointed ministories in the main one and ending it with the grand reunion of all characters that have not died explicitly on screen after 2 and a half hours and basically telling the world that time travel is possible and it will be soon available at a farm near you. i will be brief on my rating of the main cast matt mccon is looking more and more like peter newman in the 70s and getting pretty good followed by jess chastain with solid delivery the rest are a mess anne hathaway is 310 and matt damon boy ... what happened to him ? michael caine is ok but no cigar. the plot is pretty shabby when looked from above pun intendedand the mini new age anecdotes are kept in check until the last half hour when we are subjected to full blown loss of control over whatwhenhowwhere.. anything goes keep calm and wait until everyones standing up. wait for the video.,14
2014.11.14,5,i am baffled by the near universal praise this movie is receiving here on imdb.  out of 2 hours and 49 minutes  about a half hour was spent watching people crying  every star got their turn  about a half hour was spent watching people docking spacecraft with their joysticks under great duress. really? with that ai robot thingie we cant automate the docking? and what oh what does docking add to the story?  about another half hour was spent watching matt damon in a deadend downer subplot and then another half hour was spent watching cornfields burning in the distance  why? just why? so right there we could cut the movie down to about an hour and we will only have about 40 minutes left to go. leaving maybe 10 minutes or so that were visually interesting... moderately. there were no visual breakthroughs of any kind in this movie  zip. and listen i am a lifetime scifi fan. so the movie had a wormhole and some time distortion. please is that in itself enough to satisfy anybody who cares about this stuff or do you maybe have to elaborate and get creative? there was simply nothing of unusual intelligence or quality in this movie. not the writing not the acting not the directing not the visuals. in the large theatre where i saw this with hundreds of people one person starting clapping at the end. and the crowd laughed. if youre a christopher nolan fanboy then by all means go and enjoy yourself and give it a ten. if thats not you spend the time doing your taxes or something you will thank me.,20
2015.04.13,9,i found intestellar a beautiful movie to watch and be enthralled by. after countless low grade science fiction movies parading across the screen over the decades this one will stay with me.  the viewer should watch it for story and not for the science  the cinematography is beautiful without being flashy the acting is brilliant and musical score works perfectly with the story. i was engrossed by the movie from start to finish held there by the humanity and feeling portrayed by the director and the actors. why people feel the need to compare intestellar to kubricks 2001 is puzzling  this is a completely different movie and one that when i think back to watching 2001 is infinitely more watchable. why people feel the need to pile in rate the movie 1 is beyond me and at the time of this writing 570000 people had averaged the rating out to 8.7  so dont listen to the hate just watch it and enjoy.,7
2020.11.14,10,everything about it was brilliant fxcinematographyscoresoundactingstory and the enjoyable snippets of humour throughout shocklingly good  by far the best scifi movie to exist in my top 5 movies for sure!,1
2019.12.08,10,this is first time ever that i claped to a movie and i mean ever. this is just incredible. theres no other movie as close. it could easily be the best ive ever seen. just wow....,5
2018.05.12,10,interstellar 2014 is a spaceepic that feels remarkably intimate and emotionally resonant while also being sweeping in scope and visually stunning. the mixture of earthy textures and sleek scifi aesthetics makes for an interesting visual juxtaposition between the two sets of characters. while its third act does get a little existential and abstract the narrative reasoning behind it and scientific integrity leading up to it allows for constant believability. this film never fails to have an impact on me it is truly breathtaking work. in fact it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 1010,6
2019.10.05,10,one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life!,1
2014.11.14,10,interstellar another feather in nolans cap this movie is surely one of the nolans finest blend it had everything that makes you glued to the seats and those nail biting moments i can watch it again and have the same feeling as watching it for the first time and dont be fooled by some idiots claiming that the movie is way too technical and you need to brush up your physics before watching the movie dont fall for this bullshit the movie is clear and concise and well not to mention but just like any other nolan movie this one also leaves much to your interpretation and i believe thats what makes the movies of nolan stand out from others its all about imagination with a good bit of science and what could very well be a reality i dont want to spoil it for you by revealing any interesting parts of the movie i would recommend the movie to anyone who loves watching fiction movies that makes you believe in the fiction they portray yes we are far from the reality but when you are in there watching this movie those 3 hours you become a part of the movie and it becomes the reality few movies have given me such experience in the past and this one definitely tops the chart!,1
2014.11.08,6,the problem is... stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multiplotted movie ive seen in years. i sensed overkill of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if i had a remote i would have fast forwarded through many parts.  i am a big scifi movie lover and as such i will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as imdb i was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. whats more this film was much too long 2 hrs 55 minutes including previews of trailers. no human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. lastly i want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion.,8
2015.03.28,10,the movie deserves more than 1 oscar. i was looking at peoples reviews and i was shocked. how can a great movie have so much different impact on its watchers!! interstellar is a movie that makes you fall in love with it. the sound tracks the score the emotions the love every second of the movie is great. though the movie couldnt be this great without the sound tracks made by hans zimmer. most of the work done for the movie was real the nolans style. the most obvious thing that youll notice when watching the movie is the fact that none of the things would have happened if love hadnt existed. matthew mcconaugheys act was marvelous. the emotions make you cry multiple times throughout the movie even if youre watching it for 101st time. interstellar was really more sci than fi thats why its so much different and better than any other outerspace movies.  the interstellar doesnt deserve less than 7 out of 10 if you wanna rate it.,12
2014.11.04,6,how do we begin to describe interstellar christopher nolans most ambitious film to date? there will probably be no doubt once youve seen it that it reaches for the stars whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. whereas inception showed the filmmakers refusal to be restrained by physical dimension his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time envisioning our threedimensional reality as part of a larger fivedimensional whole and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised. by imagery alone it is flawless. a dying dustchoked planet earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. a single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against saturns giant gaseous rings. bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself  one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see another is pure ice where even the clouds are snow chunks. and amidst such surreal beauty the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time. since his breakthrough hit memento christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time and interstellar is no different. it may unfold in a largely linear fashion but it plays with time more than you realise. on one hand time is relative such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven earth years passed  so much so that while matthew mcconaugheys nasa test pilot named cooper looks the same throughout the film timothee chalamet and mackenzie foy as his 15 year son tom and 10year old daughter murphy are replaced midway by casey affleck and jessica chastain respectively. that is the easier part  and then there is the scientific mumbojumbo that sees time in the context of black holes gravitational singularities and the possibility of extradimensional space. another hallmark of christophers films has been their cerebral aspirations but interstellar surpasses all his previous works by overreaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. to be sure it is very serious about being serious throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. a lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logicdefying second half that cross cuts furiously between cooper in a raceagainsttime up in space and murphy in a similar position back on earth. even without thinking too much into it one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years. yet ironically that is also the most entertaining segment of the film which otherwise spends too much time in earth years we may add on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. with his brother johnathan christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child or more specifically that between cooper and murphy who takes the parting especially badly but these supposedly heartrending scenes at the start are overwrought and no thanks to hans zimmers incessantly intrusive score terribly manipulative. in contrast a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on earth is much more poignant  and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel. much as christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between cooper and murphy interstellar is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas  and there are many bandied about here. mankinds place in space is encapsulated in mcconaugheys lament that we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. much later on matt damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct and by that we mean survivial of the individual not the human race. that is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind coopers mission itself which his mentor professor brand michael caine reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless  or selfish depending on your perspective  than what he had initially told cooper. similarly interstellar is a film of many contradictions. it wants so desperately to be intellectual so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned caltech physicist kip thorne but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling and complex narrative. it wants to be moving but it underdevelops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. and at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important to be significant to be monumental to matter like stanley kubricks masterpiece did and to be both science and fiction at the same time. indeed there is no doubt it reaches for the stars but interstellar remains right where we are  gazing up at these constellations and never quite getting any closer to them.,29
2015.01.21,3,science fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction. starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation  constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. then we are supposed to believe that a drone  one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power an entire farm. after that jonathan nolan and christopher nolan screenplay expect us to believe that a retired nasa pilot who never left earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. okay ill admit this one is possible but not likely. the first planet they decide to visit  the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation  the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot  not detected by the spacecraft instruments by the way is a prime candidate for colonization. then when the next huge wave arrives christopher nolan director makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds plenty of time to get in the spacecraft watching the wave approach and is washed away. why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! nonsensical! the next thing the nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a oneway mission suddenly goes crazy becomes a coward falsifies data and turns into a murderer! were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! dont think so! later this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. i guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!,14
2015.04.09,9,i know that interstellar is a scifi movie not just that but its also based on theories made by scientist kip thorne actually thats what makes this movie special to many people. also the movie shows the most accurate simulation of wormholes and black holes. but the real reason why people feel touched by this movie is the emotions represented by the coopermurph relationship brandedmunds relationship and dr.manns courage turned into cowardliness. all of these complicated emotions are the foundation of this movie. people may forget all about relativity wormholes and black holes but they will never forget the touchy moments through the movie when their tears silently came out. when i compare interstellar with inception i find that the idea of inception is more original and more creative while the emotions in interstellar are far more effective. both are masterpieces from the great filmmaker christopher nolan whom i thank for all of his original and unforgettable movies.,8
2014.11.08,10,if there was ever a movie that impressed me this much it would be kubricks 2001. space odyssey and scotts blade runner... this one tops both... those who respect both of above mentioned films and directors will know what im talking about everything is in its place here the direction the storytelling the musical score the acting the seriousness and grandness of it all even the little humor breaks are quality beyond doubt emotive drama dialogs and sequences are so well placed and paced not feeling pathetic but on the contrary so much thought provoking... nolan has made his lifetime masterpiece,5
2014.11.05,10,i believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science factfiction part of it. with this movie christopher nolan tried to answer some questions that science is yet to. the transition form fact to fiction was seamless. even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate they are simply beautiful  visually and emotionally. as far as the story goes i could care less as the stunning visuals and great background score more than makes up for it.  for those who are not fully satisfied with the story i can understand could be because of a very high bar set by christopher nolan himself. however dont let it hold you back if you like nolans movies. if youre gonna watch it watch it in imax. ,8
2014.11.12,10,i watched this movie last week and honesty after the ending credits i couldnt talk like before. i couldnt think like i used to be. my head was exploding...it was the second time my head hurts like this first time was memento. you will not believe this movies greatness and amazing work unless you know its christopher nolans masterpiece. what makes it even more amazing is all you see is really built and theyre not green screen or anything. its his specialty to make classic amazing movies. this one is the best movie of his entire works. you can feel every second... i will not say more...just go and watch it...also dont forget to listen carefully as well. sounds and musics are phenomenal. go and watch it... now...,15
2021.06.06,10,i wish i could listen to my favorite song for the first time again. i wish i could do that. and this is the film. this is it. the one film i wish i could watch for the first time again... so much more than scifi. so much more! thank you to the creators thank you for this experience. i am humbled by your talent. just wow.,10
2014.11.15,8,uhoh here i go again. the movies out what a week or so as i write this and imdb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? if theres justice in a rational world this would never happen. but its not a rational world anymore now is it when an mit professor can be found on tape explaining how the presidents signature health care law was built on lies and deceit and the media isnt even interested in covering the story. i could rant on but whats the point. i guess if your name is nolan any movie that comes out with the directors fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. i dont have a beef with nolan personally i think he makes some visually fantastic films this is one to be sure but most of the time i think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises. case in point  interstellar. nominally a scifi thriller the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero cooper matthew mcconaughey finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the pictures pivotal moments. im sitting there thinking this is what i came to see the movie for? im not even going to start on coops selection to save the planet just by showing up at professor brands michael caine facility. which by the way didnt it start out as some shack in the desert? when we get a tour of the place its got nasa central looking like a global conglomerate. speaking of which how is it nasas still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of earths citizens to another planet? unless im mistaken nasas primary goal now is muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. my head is starting to hurt. it was a small theater crowd last night and i usually dont do this but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as i filed out i asked him what he thought of the movie. his exact words were that was a piece of excrement only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. i wouldnt go that far but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of earth time youre going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.,19
2014.11.22,6,honestly i was expecting more from christopher nolan. the man is capable of unique vision of scope that comes across only every once in a while. such as seen in inception and the dark knight. but this? this is still a good movie but thats all. its not great mainly because of limitations in storytelling dialogue and style. the biggest problem is that nolans faults shine through more than usual. his overreliance on exposition dialogue his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. in most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. well in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. this could have been a two hour movie without a doubt and it would have been better for it. it also seems to have problems deciding what its trying to be. is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001 a space odyssey or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. certain scenes lean more towards the former some towards latter and they dont mesh at all. that being said its a fine movie. first of all its absolutely gorgeous. i have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets but every single shot of space is jawdropping. i also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like among other things. that shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual. the cast is also superb. the problems with the characters stem from the script not the actors and all of them have great chemistry together. one of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. both matthew mcconaughey and mackenzie foy as well as michael caine and anne hathaway make for a great pair and i have no complaints about their performances. alas i just cannot call interstellar a great film. the ending alone would ruin it for me but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that i never got into it. the movie has a lot of good ideas  the dying earth the robots the black holes affect on spacetime  but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isnt as good as nolans previous work. its worth watching certainly and its not a bad film not at all. just a deeply flawed one.,28
2020.08.17,10,i was speechless when i finished this film the story acting and visuals just seem to good to be true. for a film with such a big scale it does a great job establishing the world and characters it can be a lot to take in bit there is just so much emotional payoff that it makes it worth sitting through 3 hours of film. i wont spoil anything but the ending is just perfect. it makes you want more from the film but in a way that doesnt make it unsatisfying. i really have no complaints it does everything it sets out to do it is a real shame this didnt win any oscars.,5
2014.12.04,6,first i like all works of christopher nolan. even insomnia. but this movie... when i first heard about it i was very happy i couldnt wait to see it. i was sure that i will do it in imax because it deserves the best available! two days ago finally with two friends i watched it. none of us was satisfied with the result. my friend was really angry he was joking that we should ask our money back. i dont felt so wrong but the movie was way too long very very loud maybe it was only a local issue but sometimes music was so loud that i couldnt understand what actors told. story was more or less ok less... quite predictable. science part was below my expectations. we saw lot of similarities with 2001 space odyssey but that movie is a timeless classic. this one i think ill forget soon,14
2014.11.08,5,disclaimer im in general a huge nolan fan. there are times when you can ignore plot holes in films and times when you cant. you can overlook some when the pacing is fast or when the film doesnt take itself too seriously. unfortunately interstellar does neither  its unnecessarily slow and takes itself really really seriously. and its full of plot holes fallacies paradoxes and logic taking a beating in general to fulfill some emotional quotient  which i must say worked on most people. lets start with the whole premise the film is based on  in the future earths resources have been drained and everyone has turned into farmers  with conscious efforts to eradicate science education in general to force people to go into farming. lets take a moment here to realize just how ridiculous that premise is. moving on  our protagonist is a genius nasa astronautengineer turned farmer because yknow everyones a farmer  and the first half mostly shows him bonding with his family with completely unnecessary scenes to prolong the film  like taking down a lost drone by pointing things towards it which had no relation to the story later whatsoever. then our hero stumbles onto a nasa facility if you arent a farmer youre with nasa after decoding things which occurred due to... uhh gravitational anomalies. this nasa facility as claimed by uberscientist michael caine was humanitys best kept secret though 5 minutes into that  all our heros family members were informed about it.  so anyways since our hero stumbled into the facility anyway uberscientist decides to send him into space to save humanity because well just like that. we get to see our hero saying goodbye to his family and immediate fast forward  hes in space! no training no nothing! economic storytelling certainly and it wouldve worked had the other scientists on board later didnt have to explain things and plans to him on the fly which for all intents and purposes shouldve been explained before leaving  and having conversations that were mostly like what college freshmen studying physics would have. oh and discussions about love! love transcending all dimensions  when humanity is at stake! anyway so future earth has the technology to do all this and build robot a.i.s which were more human than most humans but it doesnt have doctors any more or any other visible technological advancements for that matter. all efforts to save humanity were concentrated on one and just one uberscientist whod been working on his cureall formula for years. and every other scientist have just been waiting for him to solve it all himself! and whats this? other nations you ask? well there aint no other nation apart from the usa to do earth saving is there? this is something i particularly take offense to scientists dont work that way. so nolan throws more science at us on the fly which everyone dodges. but in the end everything is explained by yep five dimensional space! somehow our hero gets into such a space goes back in time opening up a ton of paradoxes behind a bookshelf in 5d space and uses vague messages to communicate with his daughter back in time instead of giving clear messages like im your father back in time. his daughter when all grown up  suddenly realizes that it was his father all along and we get no clue as to how she got to that conclusion  but hey plot twist! and with that new information she becomes the new uberscientist saving everyone. how? by making an orbiting space station around saturn for which you somehow required quantum data from other galaxies and black holes?. so okay uhh... its complicated. there are however some great visuals 3d wouldve done justice and soundtrack in this and hence the 5  but ultimately nothing we havent seen before. beyond all that glitter theres no gold  just a forgettable movie.,37
2019.02.28,10,soundtrack is amazing realistic 2001ish space happenings story without potholes it is a fantastic movie! no other way to say it. the soundtrack fits the scenes scenes that are well writen acted in a natural manner filling a story that just makes sense.,3
2015.04.16,8,as i begin this review of christopher nolans latest movie i want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with interstellar. i truly believe this to be the movies best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. having said this i believe that many viewers were divisive over the plots complexities. in fact this is the most emotion driven movie ive seen from nolan something that he isnt ultimately known for. nolans strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. he is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. once again this is proved in every frame shot for interstellar. so leaving behind my long praise i now redirect this review to the story. the earth is dying as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. upon this dark scenario former nasa engineer cooper mcconaughey is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. this of course in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. personally i liked the story nolan told us with this film as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over something nolan does very well with his projects. compared with his previous work there are still movies that i love more than this. still interstellar is a brilliant film in its own right and yet another great addition to this great directors filmograhpy. in the end all i can say is if youre a scifi fan you surely must not miss this one. it will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched even if you didnt feel completely satisfied. rating 810,18
2014.11.10,10,one of the best scifi movies.first of all it is incredibly beautiful to watch. honestly it was so beautiful that i felt like i was sucked into the movie. we can feel the talent of christopher nolan just by looking at the way it is filmed. the techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. these two important parts image and sound create a stunning atmosphere. you will forget you are in a movie theater and you will be lost in space sucked into the adventures of this new space odyssey begging for more. it is a truly unique experience. i can say that i have never felt something like that in a movie theater. then of course the cast. first of all matthew mcconaughey. i discovered this actor in tropic thunder but he didnt really convince me though he was quite funny. then i saw dallas buyers club. since that movie i love him. in this movie... well he is the movie. i exaggerate a bit since there are other great actors some even unexpected with a special guest who play extremely well. but he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story which is very important in interstellar. he is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story as a father as a human. anne hathaway was very convincing all together the actors managed to create some harmony which makes the human interactions credible. caine chastaing and affleck are a perfect choice. and then there is... the special guest i will call him x. his role which could be seen as a minor role is actually much more important than that. he proves once again that he is a great actor. watch and see. and finally the scenariostory. i wont spoil anything here ill just try to convince you how great it is. nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. well once again he did it. with the dark knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. with interstellar hes revolutionizing the scifi genre in cinema. from what i heard he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with that movie. and we can feel and see it. during the fifties asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. lucas and kubrick did the same in cinema. today nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done brace yourselves my friends we have not seen anything yet. my rating for this movie can only be a 10 because in itself it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. it is a classic. those who say we cant compare this movie to 2001 space odyssey nor can we compare nolan to kubrick are wrong. we can and we should. talented people dont live only in the past some genius live today among us. and nolan is one of them. many say that he is overrated. i truly dont think so. only time will answer that. this is the scifi movie of the decade. just go for it without a second thought.,48
2014.11.12,10,i bought a big popcorn didnt eat because it was making noise  i bought a big coca cola  didnt drink it because didnt want to go to make pee i breath from my open mouth  because i had cold and didnt want to be disturb by that this is my first review of a great moviefrom my above words one can really understand how excited i was during this space epic of nolan and a great contagious and poisonous soundtrack of hans zimmer  this movie made me forget about everything i had in my mind for almost 3 hours and at the end of the movie i was getting upset that this is going to be soon over and i just dont want it  from beginning to the end  this journey was full of excitement and surprises  this movie was like few other movies where you really dont know through every frames of movie  what you will find out next   i am fan of every nolans work and i also expected a lot from this movie but coming out of the movie i felt like not to mention anything about it and just to go back and sit in the middle to experience again  many thanks to nolan and zimmer.,1
2014.11.06,10,the earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. the plant life is dying. the very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. there are some underground efforts headed by prof. brand michael caine called lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near saturn. cooper matthew mcconaughey is a retired nasa engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. despite the stiff objections of his 10year old daughter murphy mackenzie foy he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists amelia anne hathaway doyle wes bentley and romilly david gyasi.  from there we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentallychallenging writer and director in the film industry today christopher nolan. front and center in this spectacular scifi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. the poetic story he has written is multi layered and emotional despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings. as with his other projects nolan works with some of the best technical talents many of whom are awardwinners in their fields. everyone on this team are guaranteed at least oscar nominations for their work in this film and they may in fact all actually win. film editor lee smith sound engineers gregg landaker and gary rizzo and musical scorer hans zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. the cinematography of hoyte van hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots both on earth and on those other planets. the visual effects are innovative as ever particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. production designer nathan crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. the circular design of the mother ship endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. the designs of the robotic sidekicks tars and case are in no way similar those in star wars.  matthew mcconaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an oscar earlier this year. michael caine was as good as he could be expected to be. however i found his final speech too garbled to be understood well and it contained an important plot point. anne hathaways role is a bit of a puzzle for me. while she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered. three talented actresses portray the character of murphy cooper at different ages mackenzie foy jessica chastain and ellen burstyn. foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the breaking dawn films and the conjuring. chastain is such a riveting presence as ever and it was good to see her again after her long break after zero dark thirty and mama.. oscar winner burstyns singular big scene made me tear up. in the second hour i was surprised to see a special heretofore uncredited big name guest star portray one of the pioneer lazarus astronauts dr. mann. this was more than a mere cameo appearance as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story. from memento then the prestige to inception nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. his work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. they are thoughtprovoking and demanding in terms of a viewers patience and concentration. interstellar joins this stellar list and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 1010.,36
2022.01.13,10,greatest of all time. you should definitely watch this movie. if you havent watched it you are missing out on a lot. a masterpiece with its music and fiction.,4
2021.07.02,7,pros actually no sound in space finally very well done. atmosphere of the desolate and loneliness have been captured perfectly. big fan of the soundtracks overall good acting only the protagonist didnt fit too well for me nice idea and story. cons predictability. the ghost and the meeting at the end with a very old murphy were both pretty obvious to come 23 into the movie. also how the heck did the dad get out of the black hole.,6
2022.05.20,10,incredible music some of the best actors in the world and visuals that got oscars. the soundtrack of this movie has a fanbase of its own and mcconaughey plays the role of an argumentative pilot perfectly. best movie ever made.,3
2014.11.11,7,9.1 at imdb? seriously?? 4 of my 5 stars are for the visual effects. 1 star is for mcconaugh and hathaway. the nolan brothers however get zilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and quasiphilosophy. it is a mystery to me why some filmmakers love to mix so much science into their movies when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic misleading incomprehensible and incorrect. kubrick avoided most of the science talk and created an artistic expression of the spaceandtime mystery. thats why 2001 will remain a masterpiece and why interstellar will be soon forgotten. and the movie is also painfully slow 168 mins most of which are spent on closeups of mcconaugh and hathaway with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment as if that would make it look more real...,10
2014.11.24,3,i sent to see interstellar on saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. the film i went to see was dull preposterous and far far far too long. lets start with the idea. a good one but poorly displayed. i wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. all i got was old folk i am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920s and 1930s? perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? i also wanted to know more about cooper but we didnt really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. when did his wife die? why is his father in law living with him? did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. this made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. but the biggest downfall of the film is matt damon. i am a fan off his but not in this. he is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with cooper and ryan is poor. it is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasnt got the codes but you never felt ryan was in jeopardy. it was so poorly constructed. overall vey similar to inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like inception it is style over substance. beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of quality street  very disappointing. and the title of my review? i am just a bit fed up that nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? in the emperors new clothes nobody tells the emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. somebody needs to tell nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding scifi full of characters you barely care about.,25
2023.11.02,10,christopher nolans interstellar is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the realms of space exploration human survival and the unbreakable bonds of love. with its breathtaking visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score by hans zimmer the film takes audiences on a journey that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intimate connections between a father and his daughter. set in a dystopian future where earth is dying the narrative follows a group of astronauts led by the former pilot cooper matthew mcconaughey as they embark on a perilous mission through a wormhole near saturn in search of a new home for humanity. the film beautifully juxtaposes the vast cold expanse of space with the warmth of human emotions making it a deeply moving experience. the scientific concepts including black holes time dilation and the theory of relativity are intricately woven into the plot making interstellar not just a visual spectacle but also a thoughtprovoking exploration of the mysteries of the universe. while some may argue that the film takes certain liberties with scientific accuracy its essential to remember that at its core interstellar is a work of fiction meant to entertain inspire and provoke thought. the performances are topnotch with mcconaughey delivering one of his careerbest roles. anne hathaway jessica chastain and michael caine also shine in their respective roles bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. however what truly sets interstellar apart is its emotional depth. the films exploration of love sacrifice and the passage of time resonates deeply making it a tearjerker for many. the relationship between cooper and his daughter murph played by mackenzie foy and later by jessica chastain is the beating heart of the story and their emotional reunion is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history. in conclusion interstellar is a grand ambitious and emotionally charged film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and filmmaking. its a testament to nolans genius that he can craft a narrative that is both epic in scale and deeply personal in emotion. a mustwatch for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges entertains and moves the soul.,14
2019.04.30,10,i have watched this movie 3 years ago  since then i couldnt stop thinking about it . im a huge nolan fan and this movie was the finest work that he ever did... the duality between nolan and hans zimmer took it highest level of perfection in interstellar. i have never seen anything like this... i would recommend you to see this masterpiece as soon as you can even if you love scifi or no.,5
2022.11.26,10,the story script acting directing editing photography casting climax and non stop questioning of our faith whatever that may be in every dimension...and doing all of this with one of the most original beautiful and contextual scores ever produced. no other production gets close and not sure if it will ever get close and i truly hope it will one day for future generations...as a father as a son as a brother as a husband as an avid reader and forever want to learn more student of science art politics history philosophy and finally as a man of faith...despite the fact the movie and its premises are speculative due to its beautiful message about love transcending time and space i think about interstellar in some shape or form every day... ps screenprism search on the web is a good place to learn more about interstellar...in search of more logical explanations between what we know today and unknown...,7
2024.08.09,10,i dont really think this movie will ever be surpassed in my movie rankings. it has the most stunning visuals of any film i have seen. the acting is incredible across the board. i cry every time i watch it. the story is very compelling and unique for a world ending movie. the musical score by hans zimmer is perhaps the most beautiful thing my ears have been blessed to hear. this film just gives me a certain unmatched feeling of awe and wonder. this film alone makes christopher nolan my favorite director. i recommend this movie to everyone that is on this earth. its a must watch. oh and it has matthew mcconaughey by the way.,11
2024.08.10,10,after watching this film over 5 times. most recently just now i cried. i dont really know why but i did. maybe its just how im feeling today but it made me weep. i have to admit i saw it when it was first released and i liked it but i have since compared it to my other science fiction favourites such as gravity and arrival  the latter being my favourite science fiction film of all time. but christopher nolan sees the art of film making from a totally different perspective this film being a vehicle for his masterful imagination. i finally get it. this film makes me feel so small yet connected to everything. the cinematography the score the acting is incredible. i will rewatch again and again when i feel i the need to ground myself and realise how incredible and fragile life is.,10
2022.08.15,10,after watching it i found myself crying. i cant describe the feeling. it was an amazing experience. my scifi fan friends and i have watched it over and over again a million times.,4
2014.11.12,6,i went into this movie knowing little about it no plot details or even whether christopher nolan was director or just a producer. i have enjoyed nolans previous movies but i dont care who is behind the camera aslong as the film is serving its purpose which is to entertain. so half an hour goes by the tone is set. there is a crisis with the cropsearth is running out of food a lot of dust no explanation for any of it just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..hes an ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. struggling to stay awake. okay so the next act things pick up we have loud launch into space im awake again. then silence after all thats whats space is like yknow. can now hear people munching popcorn. too quiet. oh look huge water planet vast and empty much like this film so far. huge wave comes.ah some entertainment at last clunky robot runs around... then matt damon ! the last act blackholes and then there is an semi interesting twist to earlier events. this was a frustrating film had a lot of potential with the story but on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesnt get there. it starts and stalls. did anyone really care about the characters? i certainly didnt invest. obviously some people love it with the scores on here but i cannot agree. this is not a masterpiece in scifi by any means. there are comparisons to 2001 but dont even go there.i actually looked at my watch towards the end of the film to see how long id been trapped in this cinematic black hole.,26
2023.09.18,10,i wish i could erase it from my memory and watch it again. this movie made me love movies and series. i rewatched it until i forgot how many times i rewatched it. full of feelings adventure and that great music that can never be forgotten. he took us to a wonderful space as if we were with them a great movie that will not leave my memory until i die. there will never be a movie on the same level as this movie. it breaks the laws of spacetime and remains wonderful no matter how many times you watch it again or how much time passes through it. thank you christopher nolen. thank you matthew. thank you to everyone who contributed to this work.,10
2015.07.25,6,i am fine with giving it 6 stars for entertainment value. but i am wondering why so many people think this is a great movie!? the movie is far too sentimental clichd and notconformingtoknownlawsofphysics of the known universe to earn the status of a great movie. when i say notconformingtoknownlawsofphysics i am not necessarily referring to the wormholes or time travel. i am referring to simple things like driving a truck with a flat tire through the corn fields. all in all i like the premise this movie is built upon. although i have put the spoiler alert in my review i will still try not to spoil is too much and just say that them is nothing but future us is a fascinating concept. and the moral messages in the movie are pretty standard and i am ok with that too. however one thing bothers me. i have watched most of the top 100 movies in imdb and i generally agree with those ratings. the current rating for this movie is not doing justice for other top movies in imdb. all i am saying it that this does not belong in the first 100. i hope that anomaly in the gravity pun intended will be fixed over the time.,13
2014.11.17,3,unfortunately the film didnt reach the high expectations i had for it! i love scifi movies but interstellar left me flat and disappointed. first the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the earths problem with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. i thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well they did for a while but then the crew landed on the ice covered planet and things got pretty sour. the idea of cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was ok and obviously left for a 2nd film. the sound was not good at all  i could barely hear and understand what they were saying so maybe 50 of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes. at the end i thought  this is a film for people who doesnt like sci fi movies dont believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. i suppose they got to watch something like that and like it... i appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but its not for me.,10
2024.03.19,10,interstellar is mind blowing to say the least! emotional family bond survival of the human race plot twists interdimensional time and space travel with insane scifi theories and gorgeous scenery. betrayal with an incredible cast and legendary director christopher nolan delivers one of the greatest movies of all time. this is a movie everyone must see and appreciate. earths population and its human inhabitants must find an alternate planet to survive. a wormhole was discovered near saturn that contains hope for the human race. time is relative and a ghost from the future communicates through a dimension unknown to present day earth. will the human race become ghosts as earth loses its ability to sustain life? interstellar ... enjoy the ride!,10
2023.10.29,10,interstellar is a visually stunning film with some of the most impressive special effects ever seen in a science fiction film. the films depiction of space and black holes is both aweinspiring and scientifically accurate. nolan also does a masterful job of creating a sense of scale and scope making the audience feel like they are on the journey with the astronauts. in addition to its visual effects interstellar is also a deeply emotional film. the story explores themes of love loss sacrifice and the human spirit. the films performances are also excellent with mcconaughey and hathaway giving particularly standout performances.,6
2019.03.11,9,a fiction on facts how our existence is driven.. an amazing storyline to define time dimensions and how mathematics makes our survival. its a story for our next generation to harp on. cheers to the makers. must watch !!,5
2022.12.12,10,this movie is brilliant. for the first time i am writing a review of a movie. this movie makes me feel like i am watching a new film every time i re watch it. the visuals story direction music... everything is so good. we will get what we expect by seeing a scifi movie. its not just a scifi its more than that. a family mystery scifi drama thriller. some scenessome visuals which we will never forger. a christopher nolan masterclass. maybe many great movies will come later in scifi genre but the benchmark nolan set is tougher to break. the science is also accurate. i dont know why i got so much fond of this movie. just watch and enjoy the endless space and limitless emotions.,14
2023.09.18,8,i have waited long before watching this movie. the length of this movie scared me so i kept postponing watching it. recently my fellow students kept reminding me that interstellar is a mustsee so i tried. i can say one thing postponing was a mistake. this movie is such a masterpiece. everything is spot on. the thing i love the most is the music. hans zimmer killed it again. without his compositions this movie would not have worked. the visuals are also beautiful. i never thought a scifi movie would feel so real. in short i can honestly say i would recommend this movie. it is a mustsee.,13
2023.04.11,7,nice effects but the storyline although very much hyped for its scientific accuracy is absolutely nonsense. wormholes do not exist for a start. the view of the black hole might be somehow accurate but the idea that you could somehow get close to the accretion disk and survive is hilarious. the end of the movie is rather pathetic and free of any realistic aspects. maybe someone without any scientific background believes in the pseudo science of this movie but advertising this movie for realism is a very long shot. i was reading many reviews and had high expectations but left the cinema rather disappointed. the movie is full of inaccuracies and i rather watch a fantasy movie like starwars or startreck but not this pseudo scientific nonsense story.,7
2024.03.25,9,watched it again 10 years later. absolutely brilliant. for sure a bit overwhelming if you are into space exploration and stuff but very well made. if you are not fully invested you will probably lose the plot so keep that in mind. acting is incredible of course and visuals are stunning. what takes 1 point for me is the ending. and no im not talking about the black hole. it wouldve been great if that was the final scene. anyways if you are wondering should i watch this movie the answer is  absolutely but only if you are fully prepared to be engaged all the time. its a rollercoaster movie and it will stay with you for a while.,10
2014.11.13,7,i really wanted to like this movie i really did. im a huge science fiction fan and if nolan had kept the realism and tone that the first hour or so promised i wouldve been more than happy with this film. nolans imagination is impressive an expansive force that drives many of his movies. however it is also his downfall in interstellar a film in which he doesnt have the satisfying answers to reconcile the realistic fiction he wants to portray. the plot is littered with points that exist because well...science. for instance the characters refer frequently to an equation michael cains character is investigating to solve a gravity problem. but not much explanation is put for into how this would solve anything about bringing a colony of people into space. finally this opinion will probably cause many people to ignore me i feel nolan is still a very good filmmaker but this movie glimpses him falling into the same black hole see what i did there? which ensnared m. night shyamalan. because inception and his dark knight trilogy were such a massive profound success he feels the need to make every ounce of dialogue ooze from the actors mouths as if its the most important mindaltering thing youve ever heard. the movie becomes bogged down with long dragging sequences of people staring as if in wonder coming to realizations that are meant to inspire awe in us. however these do little more than bloat an already overlong running time that felt like 7 years but amounted to one earth hour. the end serves up a slew of maddeningly predictable twists that were pretty obvious an hour before the big reveal. i will say the acting is done incredibly well by the cast even if their script is not always on par with their talents. as always nolan is exceptional with visuals and most of the tremendously dramatic middle portion was effective albeit borderline overdone with sap. i couldve managed without as many repetitions of dylan thomas do not go gentle into that good night. a beautiful poem that is awkwardly spouted throughout the film. a couple times was effective five times was pretentious. this will not deter me from seeing future nolan feature presentations however it in no way deserves the imdb 9 rating that it has simply because it is nolan. i can see why people would be impressed enough by the visuals to forgo the convoluted flawed story but not enough to land the film in any top 250. if this exact film were released under any other filmmakers name besides perhaps spielberg or the like i can guarantee you it would be far less lauded by audiences.,23
2014.11.18,2,heres its 2 stars...i saw it in imax so i enjoyed going through the wormhole. other than that? well lets get started... its so typical  almost clichd!  the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. interstellar is a prime example of this. it just might be the definitive example. im not going to go into the science much because im a tad science and spaceilliterate but even i could see glaring holes in this tripe. for one thing what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? why werent drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? that corn looked pretty green to me didnt you think so? whats going on in london or montreal or buenos aires or anywhere other than kansas? is kansas the last place anyone is? cant the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? why is nasa housed inside the bonaventure hotel? okay sorry im from la and recognized it right away did matt damon owe someone a role and thats why hes in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? why werent matthew ms grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? who the hell cast matthew m in this? how was it possible to relay tapes from loved ones at home across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? what was up with that stupid robot? okay forgetting science and crazyass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eyerolling. remember that notoriously stupid moment in armageddon when liv tyler screams that my father up there!? well the entire human aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. what was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight highly scientific aweatthemajestyoftheuniverse harsh reality scifi film that didnt insult you at every turn instead of this zgrade soap opera with neato visuals?,26
2022.07.03,10,this is a masterpiece movie ... christopher nolans brilliance ... interstellar is my favorite movie ever. ... every time i watch this movie i get goosebumps. the background music was another level ... i love this music hans zimmer whenever i hear interstellar music i get goosebumps.,6
2024.08.18,10,truly the best of nolan and my favourite oat ofc there is a diff between greatest and favourite this may not be the greatest movie but for me for sure is my favourite. this is the perfect film for me  there is no time that i watch this movie and do not cry  i also really like the scifi aspect of this movie too  too bad they didnt make a sequel maybe its better that way. the acting especially of matheww is just so good i cant explain how or why he was in his prime in 2014 true detetctive and then this he was in the mood that year  flawless acting  those who didnt cry watching titanic will for sure cry on this one lol.,3
2023.11.06,10,interstellar directed by the renowned christopher nolan is an epic science fiction film that deals with the themes of environmental collapse and interstellar travel. the story follows a future earth facing ecological disaster with cooper nasa pilot leading a team of scientists on a cosmic odyssey through a wormhole. their mission is to discover a new home for humanity leading to encounters with time dilation relativity and the strangenesspuzzling way of the cosmos. below i have listed what i think are the films key strengths 1. performances the cast led by matthew mcconaugheys portrayal of cooper delivers performances that resonate on an emotional level. mcconaugheys acting along with anne hathaway jessica chastain and other cast members infuses the characters with depth and authenticity. 2. narrative the film ventures into the realm of complex scientific concepts and seamlessly melds them with a profoundly human story. it interweaves themes of love sacrifice and the survival of humanity. 3. visuals christopher nolans directorial prowess in conjunction with cinematographer hoyte van hoytema created a visual spectacle. the films depiction of the cosmos the intricate wormhole and alien planets leaves an indelible impression. notably the reliance on practical effects over cgi amplifies the sense of immersion and makes it seem even more realistic. 4. brain stimulation interstellar engages the audience with its exploration of advanced scientific concepts including time dilation and the craziness that are black holes. it offers a unique and stimulating experience for those intrigued by science. this is great for someone like me that doesnt really like to sit and watch movies. 5. emotional simulation the film excels in evoking a spectrum of emotions from heart wrenching separations to a profound sense of hope and human connection. the central fatherdaughter relationship adds a deeply personal layer to the grand cosmic story. to add to this hans zimmers musical score plays an instrumental role in intensifying the emotional impact of the film. the use of sound and silence within the vacuum of space amplifies the realism and tension in pivotal scenes. in summary interstellar is an amazing movie that breaks the rules of traditional scifi. it has great acting creative direction and explores important themes that will stick with you. the film blends science and storytelling well and makes you feel deep emotions making it a true masterpiece. if you love scifi and movies that make you think and feel you should definitely watch interstellar.,26
2020.10.28,10,nolan not only brought me to tears with this title but made me fall in love with the story and historic placement,1
2024.03.13,10,i told you about my ghost. nolan once again takes us on a journey ive watched this movie at least 20 times ive watched reactions of more than 50 people watching it ive never not been hooked every goddamn time this movie needs to be played at my funeral this movie is the best movie there is and nothing will ever surpass it for me i watched it when i was 17 i am 27 and im still watching it it simply never gets old it holds the intensity the whole way the fact that this movie didnt win 14 oscars utterly blows my mind. if you havent watched this movie i dont even know what to tell you theyre us.,3
2025.09.01,6,ive just rewatched interstellar and honestly i dont know whether to give it a standing ovation or throw my remote at the wall. the first two hours? incredible. proper edgeofyourseat scifi. the visuals are stunning zimmers score is insane and the whole time dilation stuff on millers planet is some of the best science fiction ive ever seen on film. that ticking sound while years pass back on earth? brilliant. i was completely hooked. and then... the third act. cooper drops into gargantua and suddenly were in this weird floating bookshelf dimension. all the carefully built science from the first two acts just gets tossed straight into a black hole. suddenly the big answer to the universe isnt physics or relativity  its love. love transcends space and time. thats the line. thats the explanation. from there mcconaugheys crying into the fifth dimension somehow tapping out the fate of humanity through a wristwatch in morse code. murph instantly decodes all this insanely complicated quantum data from a few ticks saves the human race in an afternoon and thats it. sorted. perfectly believable. its such a shame because the emotional core of the film  the fatherdaughter relationship  actually works. mcconaughey and chastain sell it. if nolan had trusted the audience to feel it without spelling out the love is the secret of the universe nonsense it couldve landed beautifully. instead it just feels... pretentious. for me interstellar is a film of two halves first half  a tense grounded stunning scifi masterpiece. second half  nolan disappears into a glowing bookshelf and doesnt come back. its still worth watching for the visuals the score and the ideas but that third act stops it from being the alltime great it could have been. verdict a nearperfect movie that gets lost trying to be profound and ends up drowning in its own nonsense.,29
2022.08.15,10,there is no other movie like interstellar. they showed the facts 9 years ago and today we are getting to know that they were right. i went into it so deep that i forgot my own existence in real life. im kinda into 5 dimensional illusion right now. i can sit for hours just listening to the soundtrack they used.,5
2024.07.17,7,interstellar is one of christopher nolans bestknown films praised by many for its compelling story and visual style. at the same time although the film starts out really spectacular and interesting it struggles with many flaws. let me break it down. nolans direction is great one of his most atmospheric ones besides inception. the film is visually outstanding both the cinematography and the effects look beautiful. the performances are fantastic especially from matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway. the films score is brilliant hans zimmers music is incredibly well composed and without a doubt it adds to the atmosphere. however although the story of the film begins interestingly and engagingly it gets too confusing at the end. the ending feels way too much and completely out of place. unfortunately this is the low point of interstellar and even considering its strengths it remained a mediocre experience for me. so all in all although interstellar starts really well the ending unfortunately detracts from the overall viewing experience and at the end of the day its nothing extraordinary.,11
2014.11.11,3,this film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them which results in an over sentimental mess that is called interstellar. nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind in fact hes just a hollywood pet with cheap tricks. there is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind interstellar but he also shows clearly that he doesnt put much trust in the audiences intellect.  this results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. the sentimentality which is most of the time laughable doesnt go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. the problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing  instead nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesnt trust his audience hes lack of vision doesnt come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film in other words he is a bad filmmaker.,6
2022.08.13,10,it is a masterpiece especially on the big screen. for me it is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. the soundtrack fits perfekt and hans zimmer did a great job. i really can recommend this movie.,4
2025.02.11,10,interstellar 2014  a cinematic masterpiece of science and emotion christopher nolans interstellar 2014 is a breathtaking scifi epic that seamlessly blends hard science with deep human emotions. the film starring matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway jessica chastain and michael caine explores themes of time space love and survival making it one of the most thoughtprovoking films of the 21st century. with stunning visuals a gripping narrative and hans zimmers unforgettable score interstellar is more than just a movieit is an experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. plot overview set in a dystopian future where earth is facing environmental collapse interstellar follows the journey of cooper matthew mcconaughey a former nasa pilot turned farmer who is struggling to provide for his two children murph and tom. with crops failing and dust storms becoming more frequent humanity faces extinction. when cooper stumbles upon a secret nasa base led by dr. brand michael caine he is presented with a dangerous but crucial mission to travel through a mysterious wormhole near saturn in search of habitable planets for humanitys survival. cooper reluctantly leaves his children behind particularly his daughter murph with whom he shares a deep bond. he joins a team of astronautsincluding dr. amelia brand anne hathaway romilly david gyasi doyle wes bentley and the ai robot tarson the spacecraft endurance. their journey takes them to distant worlds each presenting unique challenges and dangers. themes and symbolism one of the most powerful aspects of interstellar is its exploration of time and relativity. the crews visit to a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole gargantua results in a severe time dilationone hour on the planet equals seven years on earth. when cooper and brand return to their ship they discover that over two decades have passed. this heartbreaking reality is reinforced when cooper watches video messages from his nowadult children highlighting the painful consequences of his sacrifice. the film also delves into the concept of love as a force beyond time and space. dr. brand passionately argues that love transcends dimensions and this is symbolized through coopers bond with murph. despite being separated by lightyears their connection remains intact ultimately playing a pivotal role in the films climax. science and realism nolan collaborated with theoretical physicist kip thorne to ensure scientific accuracy making interstellar one of the most scientifically grounded scifi films. the depiction of black holes wormholes and time dilation is based on real physics and gargantuas visualization is considered one of the most accurate representations of a black hole in cinematic history. the movie successfully balances scientific realism with artistic liberty making complex theories accessible to the audience without compromising the emotional depth of the story. performances and emotional impact matthew mcconaughey delivers one of his finest performances as cooper. his portrayal of a father torn between duty and love is deeply moving particularly in the scene where he breaks down while watching messages from his grownup children. jessica chastain as the adult murph adds intensity to the film showcasing a daughters unresolved pain and determination to complete her fathers mission. anne hathaway brings depth to her role as brand especially in her speech about loves power as an unexplored scientific force. michael caines performance as dr. brand is equally compelling particularly when he recites dylan thomass poem do not go gentle into that good night which becomes an emotional refrain throughout the film. even supporting characters including the ai robots tars and case add humor and warmth to an otherwise intense narrative. hans zimmers score one of the most unforgettable elements of interstellar is hans zimmers musical score. using a church organ to create a haunting yet majestic soundscape zimmers music enhances the films emotional weight. tracks like cornfield chase stay and no time for caution perfectly accompany key moments making the audience feel the vastness of space and the urgency of time. cinematic excellence visually interstellar is a masterpiece. the vastness of space the eerie silence of distant planets and the mesmerizing beauty of the black hole gargantua are captured with breathtaking detail. hoyte van hoytemas cinematography and nolans practical effects give the film a sense of realism that cgiheavy scifi movies often lack. the use of imax cameras enhances the immersion making interstellar a mustwatch on the biggest screen possible. conclusion interstellar is not just a scifi movie it is an emotional journey that explores what it means to be human. with its brilliant performances scientific depth stunning visuals and a heartwrenching story it remains one of the greatest films of all time. whether you are a fan of space exploration physics or simply great storytelling interstellar offers a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally profound.,39
2024.04.04,10,nolan knows what he is doing the time concept has to be the best one in this nolans movie making. it has to be my top 5 movie. the cast has been incredible with the performance. fav scene has to be the one where matthew mcconaughey is in the black hole. that scene has to be my one of the favourite moments in the movie the emotions were raw and couldnt contain myself but to shed a tear on the wonderful performance. i am a fan! i cannot stress the incredible work that nolan has executed in all different levels of performance it was just miraculous and i can watch this movie back to back without not being a fan!,7
2022.11.18,10,removing the theoretical from physics ect. this film transmits an incredible energy that reaches the soul this soundtrack gives the art that a film like this deserves. ive seen it 9 times of those 9 ive gotten goosebumps every time but beware theres never a feeling like seeing it for the first time. please if you are going to see it for the first time turn the volume to maximum and enjoy this great work of art. and one of my recommendations is that you dont question the movie if youre already halfway through maybe the first 145 will get you bored but trust me nothing is more worthwhile than waiting to see the end of this movie dont worry. questions what you see just enjoy.,6
2020.04.20,10,when i watched this movie years ago i got obsessed with it even six years later i continue to watch the movie repeatedly. the story is unique. yes it is about space like many movies but not a single movie about space can even come near to interstellar. your whole body is immersed in the plot you are on the same emotional level as the actors matthew mcconaughey and jessica chastain but also christopher nolan who did a phenomenal job. my heart was pounding in those exciting scenes. i cant even describe how perfect this movie is. it is my alltime favorite and i can just recommend it to everyone.,7
2022.02.14,10,this has to be the best spacerelated movie ive seen so far. all the effects were magical! everything looked so realistic! it gets 10 stars without doubt.,4
2014.11.08,7,in short whatever your thoughts and feelings about christopher nolans inception will likely be the same for interstellar. it relied on big ideas very impressive cgi. a cast full of the best actors. a bit awkward in places and the plot had to be forced out of characters. really it was pleasant to watch a well made film.  the story begins as the world is ending blight is taking over the worlds crops. those that dont starve will later suffocate as the film describes. the biggest selling point for me was the science behind the movie. kip thorne wrote the treatment to this film.he previously worked with carl sagan on contact and is the feynman professor of theoretical physicist at caltech. if those names dont mean anything to you then know that that means the films is going to be featuring a lot of talk about general relativity. time dilation is going to be involved and as far as i am aware it hasnt been done very well in films before. it still hasnt but it makes the awkward and forced plot fun to watch plot.  i was sceptical about matthew mcconnaughey he usually annoys me. he is accepting his maturity and has become a decent actor. i was very impressed with his work. the rest of the cast is full of talent but the weak script gave them no room for development as is typical n a nolan film. a few times they did get to go on a rant they try to go deep and heavy the meaning of love survival what time means. this never worked in he film. they are only human maybe their musings were meant to be imperfect. when scifi is at its best is when it debates these issues hopefully in space. we only saw one side to each of them a little monologue to stop the conversation and dramatically move on to the next scene.  the cgi was beautiful but all cgi reliant films end up looking out of date after a few years. the acting was perfect but the script was weak. the science was exciting but it was over exaggerated and had those awkward moments where one supposed expert has to oversimplify a concept while explaining to another supposed expert so the audience can understand what is going on. best of all there were no sounds in space!,26
2023.01.20,10,interstellar is one of my 3 favorite movies it is simply art the practical effects are very good hans zimmers music is one of the best in the history of cinema the story is moving and emotional the performances especially those of mcconaughey and mackenzie foy are incredible. i dont know how interstellar was not nominated for best film at the oscars. it has certain similarities with kubricks masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey even in some aspects surpassing this one. christopher nolan is one of the best current directors and this is surely his most complex and best made film in his career surpassing the incredible inception or the best superhero film the dark knight simply incredible.,4
2025.10.20,6,although this 3 hour joy ride had epic visuals and cool concepts the writing ironically left massive black holes throughout. the characters repeatedly explain the story to the audience  e.g. coopers prepared spiel explaining his authentic backstory. or they act wildly out of character which is crazy given theres 3 hours for character development. for example when the cold stern dr brandt suddenly launches into an inexplicable tangent claiming love is an undiscovered higher dimension. and where did her crush on the other doctor come from?? i guess thats the directors attempting to juxtapose science and emotion. and things also just... happen. how does coop go through a wormhole into a black hole and then end up back in saturns orbit within minutes of death? why does the doctor create mass hysteria to leave urgently over a cough that the farm family have lived with for decades? how do coop and matt damon walk so far it takes the rescue craft miles to reach them? at least it had some kind of ending. the main character travels interstellar to get back to his daughter and sees her for 5 minutes. fantastic.,16
2014.11.21,3,the film is spectacular and starts off really nice and promises to be very interesting. but once the spaceship leaves the ground the movie deteriorates rapidly and as it progresses it becomes so unbelievable and ludicrous that i left the theater quite annoyed and very disappointed. i didnt like most of the characters. they are clichs and none made me sympathetic to their cause or character. the robot is also extremely familiar and its design is ludicrous trying to be both advanced and ancient at the same time. i really likes other films by the nolan brothers but it seems they dont give their scripts as much attention as they used to. a disappointment.,7
2022.08.18,10,easily a top 3 movie for me personally. interstellar manages to keep relism in a space exploration movie a feat few others have accomplished. christopher nolan knocks it out of the park again. if youre looking for a mind bending movie filled with action twists and turns and a soundtrack that will have you heart pumping blood through your body at an alarming rate then you need this movie in your life.,4
2023.10.01,10,the first time i witnessed the perfection of this film i was in wow. before today i had seen it already at home 3 times and every time i enjoyed it even more. its a masterpiece in every way every single time i start watching it i know i will cry at some point. in addition to the cinematography the music by hans zimmer takes the experience to another dimension. today after all these years i watched it for the first time in theatre and the experience was beyond amazing. its one of those movies that you wish you can erase from your memory and then rewatch time and time again. thank you christopher nolan!,7
2023.05.06,10,pros hans zimmer created a sound track for this movie that will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best composed musical numbers of humanity and thats not even giving it justice the story behind how he created this number makes it even better google it outstanding cast every single actor in this movie gave a performance of a lifetime. every movement every line every tear every breath of these actors made me believe i was watching peoples lives from an actual alternate universe and these were real peoples emotions. absolutely flawless performances. the cgi they used actual data and actual theories on how things actually look in space and its breath taking. the plot in the end it has you contemplating your existence. it has you rooting for the main character the entire time on the edge of your seat an emotional rollercoaster cons they did this movie so well that there wont be another movie like this for a long long time.,6
2024.12.12,10,one of the greatest movies of all time the soundtrack is truly what makes it stand apart when i saw it in theaters again. i think i would run through a wall for matthew mcconaughey incredible pull of emotions between determination sadness and confidence. anne hathaway does a great job of making the viewer share the same emotion while also letting curiosity and exploration drive the mission. hoping to bring my girlfriend one day but the concept of space time and interdimensional travel might be a little bit too much for her. so instead i saw it with the boys!! cant wait to see it again in 10 more years.,6
2023.11.09,10,best movie i have seen in my life this movie was the best written acted visual effected etc. movie. this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. i am a huge christopher nolan fan and this movie was his finest. matthew mcconaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. anne hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in les miserables i have no idea how she didnt get an oscar for this. the visual effects were more than just oscar worthy. they were pioneering. i have never seen anything like it. one thing i would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. not like einstein stuff though. i would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a nolan fan or not. i give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.,13
2022.04.25,10,i was reading some reviews about this movie and i could not find one which was fully devoted to the music of the movie. and hell yeah the music from this movie should be mentioned! this is a master piece. i could only listen to this movie and still enjoy it. however it also perfectly fits in the movie. the music made from this good movie a great movie. so please everybody buy a dolby surround set put it on the highest volume and enjoy!,7
2015.07.12,6,this movie really isnt science fiction so much as fantasy with some mixed up elements of science in it. sadly the movie lost me in the first 1020 minutes or so simply because there is no scenario where earth would have a blight or bad weather which would result in fleeing to wormhole would become a practical solution. on top of that the flight pilot thing is just ridiculous. the likelihood that you pilot through a wormhole based on human skill seems pretty small. so the premise of why people would want to do any of this was 100 flawed. given x amount of resources the simply reality is that even if earth is a barren ball of rock it still has water and it still has the right gravity and better resources. so the solution would clearly be to just work with the earth not flee into the unknown in same sensationalized effort to save humanity. it really just makes no sense and when you base the premise and central motivation of your characters in a science fiction movie with a serious overtone like this and that motivation makes no logical sense its hard to take anything after that seriously. they may as well have been setting out to look for the great flying spaghetti monster to grant them the wish that would save humanity. at least that premise would have been honest and not some silly half thought out plot point skimmed over to explain all the uselessly risky decisions the characters would take later in the movie. there is also the whole idea that youd expect a planet near a black hole to be a better place to live than earth. it has to been almost infinitely easier to fix the earth than it could ever be to transport the human population through a wormhole to a planet on the edge of a black hole. nobody would ever think that was a good idea.  as i see it the movie was nothing more than a grand setup to show off the spooky theoretical impacts of relative time differences on humans. the reasoning for their trip was not well thought out and the ending of the movie was total crap. the part most people liked is the spooky sense of how time might pass differently when your near very massive objects. of course in general its probably not all that possible to find a habitable planet that close to a black hole. there are many factors beyond the massive gravity that would have either made the planet unlivable or make it simply too risk to call home vs earth.  for the plot to work earth would have to be about to be vaporized not merely having bad weather and blight. those things can be quarantined and engineered around as long as you have water sunlight resources and somewhere near the correct gravity. for instance when they are on the planet and the giant tidal bulge that appears out nowhere which would require a very fast planet rotation. would it not have been immediately apparent that the planet was no in any way a realistic place to move humanity? it would be easier to just terraform mars or again for that matter to fix earth.  america is currently starved for good science fiction and the high rating of this movie is little more than a result of that. people are so desperate for a good science fiction movie they have overlooked the horrible plot holes. contact is another example of a horrible movie getting good ratings because people are desperate for science fiction.  even if you say ok well this movie isnt really science fiction but its good. no.. its just not. its silly misleading and completely lacks any kind of well thought out ending.  watching this sad attempt at science fiction is just utterly disappointing. so much money was spent on such a bad plot and instead of instilling the mystery of science in more people its just a silly mesh of unrealistic scenarios clinging desperately onto science to save the horrible writing. robots with vacuum cleaner arms from the 1960s are more realistic than the plot holes in this sad movie.,33
2014.11.05,10,intersellar. what christopher nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simplebut we know that its christopher nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. its not. the overall plot is that the earth is dying so coopermatthew mcconaughey and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. the acting is greatwhat makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. every time they were together it was wow. the visuals were on another level. if you cansee it on the biggest screen possible. some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that you will have a blast with this.overall interstellar is a must see. i think it was nolans best film.,11
2022.11.03,6,to be a 2.5 hours movie it is watchable. the performance of the casting somehow keeps you interested. however the science concepts they dive into weather they are accurate or no can be a little bit of a turn off and at the end the complicated relationship between cooper and his daughter was the only thing that kept the plot alive. i just basically watched the whole movie to find out if he was able to came back to earth or not to meet again with her. so yes a kind of interesting movie but if i have more than 2 hours to watch a movie i would probably choose a different one. a little bit overrated i would say.,7
2014.11.09,3,originality this movie was completely original in the exact same way that the hunger games was that is not at all. the hunger games is to battle royale as interstellar is to 2001 a space odyssey that is a complete rip off. many reviews are saying how original it is i expect these people havent seen 2001. score a few people have drawn parallels with contact saying that the movie reminds them of contact. perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that interstellar ripped off? millennium falcon when our heroes first take off from earth they do so in a saturn v type moon rocket with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. yet when they later take off from the extrasolar planets one with 130 gravity no less they do so in the conventional millennium falcon kind of scifi way. it huts my eyes! southern drawl our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry halfawake speech yet later seemed to recover. perhaps thats what timedilation does for you! the robot seriously? i think it was so big and square because it contained two crtmonitors. if you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in interstellar. but my biggest gripe was how did it walk? we have two legs! our trailing leg doesnt catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends lifting us slightly. the robot in interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design. newtons 3rd law stated correctly applied incorrectly. if our heroes spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun then it would have been a cool quip instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer. the best of the best why! why is hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? couldnt he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? with a genius daughter and an idiot son. frozen yoghurt at one point the millennium falcon space shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt or was it ice? so a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt sounds a bit silly. presumably as with arthur dents cup it was held up by art? emotional but not a black hole. possibly the best element of the movie. the human element and the pain of loss and separation was strangely conveyed extremely well. a real black hole well i wish i had one so i could get the 3 hours back that i lost watching this. its not all bad some bits are compelling but mostly its a boring reskin of 2001.,31
2014.11.16,10,were still pioneers. weve barely begun. our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us. mankind has finally used up all of earths resources and it has become a dying planet. when cooper mcconaughey and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of nasa they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. i have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part i have found it easy to talk about every movie. this one i cant seem to find the right words for. the reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. there are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. the last one i felt that way about was the passion of the christ. this is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say its just not enough. i loved gravity and this was 1000 times better. overall really nothing i can say about this movie other than watch it. christopher nolan is a genius. i easily give this an a,16
2014.11.09,10,ok so i am not the type of guy that says that every movie is good but with interstellar it is really hard not to. this is really a great movie. the story has been put together very careful and is extremely hard to follow but when you understand it you realize that it is a good movie. interstellar made me think about the science of the universe. and since a lot of information is correct in the movie the content witch is used in the movie is what we are seeing in class right now it can be in some way educational. but a lot of content they use is based on possible things. for example i think is is a real possibility that there is a 4th dimension bus for us humans it is very hard to imagine that. but they make that unimaginable 4th dimension accessible for people. but since we and some scientists are not sure that the unknown information is true is it awesome how the movie sticks together.  interstellar great plot it is awesome how the people who made interstellar take our imagination for a spin and make the possibility that the content of the movie is reality so realistically possible. that is what makes this movie so great wout selosse sunday the 9th of november at 11am belgium.,11
2015.04.03,9,at over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing i guess theres nothing left to be said other than my opinion. id probably need a phd in physics from mit to understand half of the technological terms in the movie but i still found it to be rather awesome. after reading some of the reviews here i think a lot of people are taking this scifi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally. christopher nolans latest which he cowrote as well with his brother jonathan at 2 hrs and 48 min in length can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next. matthew mcconaughy and anne hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here too numerous to mention. i did want to mention that i thought mackenzie foy as murph the 10yearold daughter of mcconaughy was terrific in her role. i thought the musical score here was excellent the wit and humor of the robot tars bill irwin was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which i liked. all in all despite its drawbacks i found this scifi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride.,9
2015.02.22,8,the first 8090 of interstellar i absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. sadly the ending inexplicably had an ending that didnt make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. its sad but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am i to complain?! as for the film there are a bazillion reviews so i will be brief. the film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. on a huge screen at home it would still lose something. like the wonderful gravity it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. the story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists up until the disappointing ending that is and there are a lot of wonderful performances. overall the good certainly outweighs the bad and its a film to see. but as for me an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.,12
2014.11.05,10,a simply breathtaking film interstellar completely blew my expectations out of the water. the nolan brothers took a huge risk in making a film about space travel but they succeeded. the movie was one of the most visually stimulating movies ive ever watched. be prepared to stare in awe. hans zimmer didnt disappoint with his original scores for the movie as well. just wave after wave of amazing cgi and music throughout the film is enjoyable just by itself. but what i enjoyed most was the fact that the movie sticks to the main theme of human survival and curiosity. everything that happens always links back to those themes. not everyone will like the movie some of the plot twists and more bizarre explanations the nolan brothers came up with will leave some laughing confused mad andor skeptical. after all it is a movie on the unknown. but the nolan brothers outdid themselves. you have to understand that there is so much in space physics and astronautics that humans cannot even fathom. you have to understand that what the nolan brothers came up with could be true or not be true theres no way to know because they came up the best interpretation for the movie based on incomplete data.  tldr one of the best movies made ever so go watch it. go in with an open mind and accept that humans do not know everything about space.,15
2015.01.22,7,theres a lot to like in this film. the way it uses real and theoretical science the way it doesnt pander to the star wars fans by showing space as it is a soundless void. theres a great deal of thought surrounding communication across time. ultimately though the film is flawed in many ways. let me list them 1 the idea that food crops are failing across the world and yet people are shown still eating wholesome meals...there is still gas for the cars and power stations still work is somewhat incongruous to me. 2 matthew mcconaughey is just not the right person to have played the lead role. he seems too laconic and the way he mumbled his dialogue at times was downright annoying. 3 i dont think the us would allow school books to be printed saying that the moon landings were a hoax designed to bankrupt russia. political correctness i suppose will probably become more intrusive in the future...but that intrusive? 4 the incident with matt damon dr. mann is just ridiculous and muddies the storyline and the pace of the film. 5 the robot design is so impractical as to be laughable. even the b9 robot from the old tv show lost in space would have worked better. 6 will hollywood please pension off mr. zimmer and his themeless exercises in going up and down the music scales to generate tension. much of the music was loud and not appropriate to scene and there really was no memorable theme at all. goldsmith would be turning in his grave! i congratulate the nolans for trying to make an intelligent scifi film in these times of dross. they have succeeded in many ways but the film is not the masterpiece 2001 is.,21
2015.01.23,10,not so much film as much as strange milestone for hollywood. with alist stars and a final running length of about 3 hours. this in an age where hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even tv shows have more commercials and less content. how is this possible? easy answer nolan brothers. look in a mirror say those names 7 times quickly the hollywood rule book disappears. the bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title. this reviewer in particular was gobsmacked by the first movie effectively from the beginning until the space flight and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town postapocalyptic setting. with the dust. and stray drones. and the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda. i cannot overemphasize how strange this is. even though that was not the point of the film i suggest the production company unintentionally created in that first hour the best scifi futureworld ambiance in the history of film and unaware of what they had accidentally done they just moved on. btw a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going super or blowing for extended days or weeks. this will place ashdust in the air will will cover the planet. until this film i never saw the image of what this might look like. now i know. wow.  the second film is like every star trek film you have ever seen but by way of stanley kubrick. not bad but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at home depot that can form a variety of shapes. ultra cool. until you finally get to the third and final movie or act which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours. which is itself a strange contradiction. but the whole film is full of contradictions. there is an epilogue too following the unstated theme of three acts and an epilogue. it is fun it is moving it connects with the viewer and it makes no sense at all. there are plot holes in the epilogue that you could lose a black hole in. joke intended. so there you go one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time. oh dont even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop ai to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before the costco ladder people still has teachers that dispute the moon landing and doctors who cant deal with a cough. as i keep saying a very strange movie. but a very powerful one  review updated oct 2016 greetings from the year 2016. for those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the imdb database probably beamed right into the cortex i am updating my review with this addenda i confess i missed the point of the film on first viewing. after all this is a nolan bros 3 hr opus which sadly never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time much like the characters in the story. on second viewing i got that this is basically a love story set against a scifi backdrop. the love of a father for his daughter the growth of man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable  these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie.,36
2023.09.06,6,i may upset  offend a few here but i feel that the film has been part of its own hype. where exactly would this film be without the special effects? i would consider myself someone who has a decent grasp of science physics  astronomy but the multi dimensional stuff was just annoying. far too cliched especially within the first hour with the secret base so close to coopers farm. lets assume within 1 day on dirt roads  they are just about ready to launch when he arrives  has just enough time to go back to his farm. however some attention to detail did seem spot on. theres no sound in a vacuum something hollywood seem to forget time  time again. watched a second time recently still really didnt do it for me. im a massive scifi fan but this wouldnt even appear in my top 10.,9
2022.03.20,4,the premise here is relativity. time vs gravity. the story if there is one is pointless. christopher nolan has surpassed stanley kubrick in making a visually stunning but ultimately pointless piece of sci fi nonsense. nobody can give me a convincing explanation of 2001 a space odyssey but in 1968 it was jaw dropping. interstellars problem is weve seen it all before and nolan is not kubrick. perhaps there is an analogy of the futility of life here but its spurious at best. this ranks with prometheus as an incredibly beautiful waste of my time.,8
2014.11.07,10,there used to be movies where the purpose of it might be giving entertainment educating or enlightening them. but apart from most of the movies interstellar is more than that. it is not a movie. you never realize that you spent 2 hrs 40 mins in the theater. it blends with you. it makes you a third person in the lives of the character watching then to go through all the experiences they have.  this is not a movie this is an absolute experience that everyone should experience. it educates you it questions you wit to the maximum level possible how many of you understand quantum physics and wave theory? it raises an innumerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain is that possible? the answer is yes and no at the same time. for believers it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for nonbelievers there are always questions that cant be answered.  apart for science the human connections are stupendous. it makes you to connect emotional not just to a character but to the future of the earth.  and the best part in the movie is subtlety in the picturing it. there is enormous possibility of making it more of a scifi journey showing colorful planets etc etc. but nolan used what is required without going for too much unnecessary visual elevations.  the science emotions story  the screenplay are the best in the movie.  it is an experience that everyone should experience. question your wits !?,19
2020.12.08,10,after watching it i was paralyze for 3 hours. pure epic!,2
2014.11.10,10,whether it is audacious or not whether it outdoes kubricks odyssey or notwhether it would get oscar or not that wont concern ! what matter is did i get the goosebumps or not while seeing ! and there it scores. you dont need to know general theory of relativity. the morse code wormholes spacetime can wait. you dont need to know physics at all. you just go to watch it and see the beauty of imax. great performance from all those brilliant actors and actresses. and then the score by none other but the great hans zimmer ! but last the nolan brothers. christopher nolan delivers again. an epic voyage with lot of emotions. the astonishing cinematography is a pleasure to our eyes. mankind is saved from destruction but it needs a great deal of courage and conviction. you get this here. entering wormhole without violating physics is yet another milestone in the genre of science fiction. a monumental film with every aspects of life and science is depicted by nolan.,17
2023.12.18,10,interstellar directed by christopher nolan was released in 2014. this film is about astronauts and scientists who went to another galaxy to find a new planet for human life. the soundtrack in the film keeps us focused and tense throughout the film. the plot is complex fascinating and attentiongrabbing from the beginning to the very end. starring matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway michael caine and many others. scientists go into space where they have discussions disagreements disputes. the main breakthrough in this film was the image of a black hole. as for me this is the best film in nolans filmography. soundtracks special effects characters plot.,9
2022.05.16,10,this is my all time favorite movie. it looks astonishing the story is deeply human and the actors all do a great job at leading through this emotional journey. 1110.,3
2023.07.01,10,what words could describe this movie? non. but i must fill this box up with letters so here are some words for you. you dont watch a movie and see all these means in it life death survival hope fear and joy all while the hero is trying to save the world but you feel as if this is a real story from our universe or from a parallel universe or from a nonparallel universe it doesnt matter what matters is that you feel that somewhere sometime this story couldve happened or would happen. how do you make a story so imaginary yet feels as realistic as our existence? i guess its murphys law. how do you have all these means in this movie but ultimately make me feel that it was just a movie about a father and his daughter? i am blown away. every single time. ive played this movie 10 times and the only thing that bothers me when i start losing myself in it is that it didnt grab all the oscars that year. but hey i saw that movie called everything everywhere everyone all together or something got all those oscars and thought good riddance best movie ive seen in my life. only one that beats the godfather.,12

2014.11.07,10,if memento was ambiguous if the prestige was smart if inception was deceiving if the batman trilogy was a revelation then interstellar is hopegiving inspiring levitating flabbergasting and more... its a rollercoaster ride of transcendental thought process. time as a relative theory astrology as a whole timetravel and lot other high level thinking is mandatory to go about the narration of this movie when our very little brain cells have a tough time differentiating between just a movie being watched in a cinema hall or being part of a galactic expedition. interstellar is a sciencefiction movie about a group of space travelers on a picaresque journey across the wormhole to find a habitable planet other than earth. sounds familiar? weve had blade runner a space odyssey contact or the recent gravity along with numerous other ambitious takes on such top level prophecies but what makes interstellar a suffocating impactive film? the amount of study that has gone into the making of the film is equivalent to a new find. be it the concept of dimensions futuristic world or the unexplainable topics to the laymen this story from the nolan brothers is rather simple than all their previous outings. interstellar in simple words is a film about a fatherdaughter relationship.  taking the dust bowl as a primary setting for the story to have a beginning mr. cooper is a farmer by choice but a trained pilot and engineer by profession. he is a single father who still believes the plight of their blight filled earth can be taken over by inhabiting another planet. his bright daughter murphy doesnt want him to go on a nasa powered voyage fearing his return. lets stop it there on making a futile attempt of describing the story. interstellar has propelled itself to the pinnacle by an undeniably superior story astute screenplay and stellar performances from the uncanny yet stubborn mathew mcconaughey as cooper the pilot anne hathaway as amelia a committed scientist micheal caine as dr. brand the chief and jessica chaistan as murphy the abandoned daughter. double negative has taken up the herculean task of doing the visual effects for a nolan film and has recreated unseen visuals of the wormhole the outer space inhabited planets of the other galaxy and of course the beautiful earth. the graphics and other digitally composited elements in the film are pretty much the lifeline for the film making the unseen portions of outer space look so convincing to us and not a compromised makebelieve platform. how will the engines of a space shuttle sound how is sound transmitted in a planet that has only 80 gravity how does a button sound when it is pressed by a finger that has astronauts gloves on it? hans zimmer can never get tired of writing topclass music scores. be it the nailbiting sequence of the shuttle docking into the mothership or the takeoff into the space or the scene where cooper gets to watch a video sent from his family the musical support in the film is a parachute like lifesaver for such a hardhitting story. he elevates the film and positions it to an unreachable height of excellence and creativity. interstellar has been filmed with anamorphic 35mm and imax 70 mm to give a different visage for the story. hoyte van hoytemas what word could you think of to describe his skill cinematography will become a standard procedure on how sciencefictions are to be shot.  made on a whopping budget of 165 million dollars nolan almost returned 10 million after filming from the original allocated budget. private corn fields were bought and cultivated to be used as a major backdrop. special imax cameras were made to shoot the interiors of the cockpit. exclusively robots were made for the film. 100 hours for rendering a single cg powered frame and what not firsttimer for a film. interstellar has started a race of its own for generation of filmmakers to follow.  einsteins general relativity morse code rotating blackhole and lot other complexities are dealt in interstellar but it is an emotional tale about the cosmos of survival. this piece of writing has no spoilers and talks nothing about how great the film is. it is just an immediate response,33
2020.05.22,7,not nolans greatest work interstellar is a slow burn mind bender but it keeps you in the game until the end and features stunning visuals and a great cast. recommend to nolan fans.,2
2014.11.11,5,its not a bad movie but its ordinary at best. dialogue is very clumsy at times. its too long and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that dont need to be explained. it could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie but instead its dead set on explaining absolutely everything. it ruins the mystery and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie exactly the way the director wants you to is spent at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. a funny idea and a powerful soundtrack just doesnt cut it for me. i was very underwhelmed and disappointed but go see for yourself.,8
2015.04.08,9,it may very well be the most remarkable film ive ever seen. interstellar is a film which plays on your emotions more than anything else. many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific inaccuracies and thus let these factors detract from what would otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to  and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. forget logic forget science. this is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. a fathers heart breaks as he realizes hes broken his daughters heart  he has left her and does not know when hell return. nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. interstellar will i feel become more appreciated as time passes and will i hope one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.,9
2023.10.02,10,the fatherdaughter relationship of interstellar is often overseen yet nolan did an extraordinary job in this domain with matthew mcconaughey perfectly executing it. as a father who has a daughter im deeply impressed how nolan touched on this subject every time i rewatch it. its so deep it almost gives an ideal blueprint of how to connect with your kids on an emotional and intellectual level and how to be the right parent for them. any father especially with a daughter would understand what i mean!  its pure gold. i have a very close relationship with my little daughter we are best friends in some way similar to that of interstellar and ive always tried to prioritize it but i find myself always learning something new from cooper and murph. as a huge scifi fan ill even completely ignore the scifi part in this review! ,7
2015.04.09,9,i was very interested in this movie my expectations were very high luckily i have been satisfied! i cant say its a masterpiece because i found something that could have been better  theres an apparent hole plot and some characters could have been realized better the plot is very difficult and articulated science is really complicated! besides movie is very long but it can not bore rhythm grows up to the end. the photography is breakthaking scenes are spectacular and do you not fell the longduration! screenplay is fantastic music is fundamental for the movie  hans zimmer composed a fabulous soundtrack . the special effects are perfect worthy of an oscar! unfortunately in my opinion interstellar has not had the attentions it deserves its a film you have to see! 910 absolutely! not to be missed!,9
2020.11.12,10,apart from the great cinematography storyline and acting. interstellar will keep you on the edge of your seat. the first time i watched it i was amazed that a film could be that awesome. christopher nolan is a true genius. after the first watching i promised myself that i had to wait 5 years to watch it again. and i did! for 5 years i ignored everything about interstellar so i would forget it and watch it like the first time. it worked and it was as good as the first time! i could watch it over and over and never get bored,9
2019.02.26,10,this film has drama action suspense emotions love environment caring. just love it,2
2023.02.18,10,ive had a strange relationship with this movie over the years. i didnt have the chance to see it in movie theaters when it came out but caught up with it on streaming release  immediately liked it except for some sections of jarring dialogue  unnecessary exposition  which admittedly took up only about 2 of the movie but had an outsized effect on me because  well  i expected and desperately wanted perfection. when i viewed it the second time i was even more angry with the nolan team for the few mistakes of the film. after all this was the movie id been waiting for someone to make for years. why couldnt it have been perfect? i saw it a third time. why you may ask? because despite the errors the story haunted me. and i had to admit to myself that it was beautifully executed  acted with possibly the best soundtrack in movie history. it was on this viewing that i managed to just let go  relax into the film. i was stunned. how could i have missed this masterpiece? a complex tightly knit scientifically accurate story kip thorne won the nobel prize in physics later in 2017 that seemed to have been plucked right out of some fictional ether instead of painstakingly worked out around a table in a story room. some stories are like that they feel more real than real like theyve always existed and were waiting for a hand to snatch them and gift them to us. it occurred to me too that some works of art like this film can have a sort of emergence  that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and that it may well take time for a culture to come to recognize its true greatness. i see now that the flaws of this film are very small and actually dont matter at all. the movies greatness transcends its own mistakes. i dont know if any movie will ever be made to match interstellar. as sad as that makes me im happy enough to just keep watching and rewatching. if you havent seen it yet  i envy you.,20
2015.06.05,7,when it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction. the first is soothing consolatory characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. the second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution by the time the story is over events have taken a major toll on those involved  maybe they have lost what they wanted or their achievement is implied to be shortlived. maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all. the first kind of fiction is spielberg the other kubrick the first is nolan of memento the other nolan of interstellar. now both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare in fact most of the time id rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like raiders of the lost ark or star wars than a fine but bleak film like say the deer hunter. the trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds the result will have major tonal problems. see interstellar in a story about entropy and loss the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. its fluffy and tonedeaf. pity because i was enjoying the movie. acting is effective with a solid mcconaughey and an unusual supporting role for damon special mention to young mackenzie foy who is fine as the protagonists daughter. at its best interstellar provides moment of awe the oceanic planet compelling dilemmas tension and pathos the scene with cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving exposition is clunkybutinteresting in an inception kind of way. but the movie lost me with its last act. when hathaways character an astronaut states unironically that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well im both religious and a big softie so i should be on board with that... it is however both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin nolan provided in the dark knight rises only its even more inappropriate here. 6510,17
2015.04.02,10,cinematography is amazing. the only thing that tops it was the acting. engaged from start to finish. played with my heart and head like it was as simple as pulling strings! the physics was sound! educational the story line brilliant! the idea of playing with time in this fashion is bran spanking new. mixing the idea of the afterlife with relativity to time being another dimension which can simply be traversed as if were an extra dimension and linking all these together....fantastic! im definitely buying the dvd! no sob stories! no boring and predictable hollywood romance! just straight up brilliant story telling. you dont watch something for 2 hours and think gosh where did the time go if the movie wasnt that awesome! really cringe moment with dr man... but we see this is in real life all the time. the greats failing at the most pivotal of moments. you may be really smart... but this story is about how love and bravery and the shear will to fight for what is a deepest of core values of the human race  survival as a species.,19
2023.04.03,6,a decent movie with a lot of production values and star power but at the end is just too surrealistic. youll hear all the usual imdb rants magnificent a triumph a masterpiece but its all overblown. slowing a movie down making it mysterious and putting the stakes so high only gets you so far. the movies starts well and who cant get enough of anne hathaways gorgeous face but like the heralded soundtrack after a while it is overhelming. not every christopher nolan movie is a masterpiece from frame to frame. not every action or lack of action has earth shattering consequence. sometime its just a highly produced and directed movie that should of had a fresh pair of eyes look at the script before it went into production.,7
2014.11.11,5,firstly i quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. about 10 minutes in though i find myself wishing for subtitles as the actors voices are inaudible. i like mm but where is clooney when we need him?  now the story idea is not half bad except nolan misunderstood the meaning of scifi...the fiction part of science fiction refers to the science portion of a narrative not the human story. leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science especially in areas not fully understoodknown by people. the human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.  too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and i believe nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. i will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me even though plenty more were present. watch out...spoilers below! 1murph had experienced the ghost from a young age yet didnt know who it might be yet when we find out that the ghost is cooper she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? that is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously yet there is no reason for her to link the ghost to her father. he could have easily added a message of this is your dad to her but he never did and even if he had it wouldnt work with the younger murph...if he had located the older murph when she was retrieving her stuff then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add maybe 20 seconds of screen time?. this one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it the movie couldnt go along the lines it did. 2assuming we accept that tor and cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. even if she did figure out that its a message from her dad or from someone important she wasnt paying attention to the message. it is like tuning in to a radio talk show on serious maths no less midway through a program there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent. 3he knew that the message stay wouldnt work to keep him on the ground. shouldnt he try a different message? of course that would change history and likely nolan didnt want to go near this paradox...but this is scifi and id welcome the debate that would bring...instead he rehashes the same old knowing it wouldnt work. 4young murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan a plan b and the importance of the mission...yet she wouldnt send him a message? if she became someone outside the scientific field i can at least accept her continued anger but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. she should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. otherwise she should understand why he had to go.   5 murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on her space station. when she suggested that coop goes to brand she could help with getting him a spacecraft. instead he had to steal one...really? security is not a concern in the future? a guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? maybe unlike now aerospace technology does not improve in a century?  the above really killed the movie for me. sidenotes a if according to their plan skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly they surely didnt spend 3 hours there. how did it translate to 23 years? well i spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense so maybe it is possible. not in the way it was shown though.  b if all of coopers electronics failed on entering the black hole how did tor survive? tor is fully electronics! poor story telling as this could be explained under scifi rules yet wasnt done. c why would murph travel 2 years to the space station with all her family in tow to visit her father...yet on seeing him sends him away? d dr mann and cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? she took so long that dr mann had the time to walk back to the station to board the other spacecraft before they fly back. ridiculous! nolan this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.  overall without a logical human story interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale. i gave it a 5 because i did enjoy some part of the movie the effects and sound otherwise it would get a 3.5 out of 10. almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. plus theres a chance youll age 23 years. i sure wouldnt watch it again.,64
2015.04.02,10,interstellar was and is a masterpiece. rather than watching a film the movie simply feels like an experience that not only requires thinking and thought process yet also creates an experience of a variety of emotions. the film is perfectly crafted with an extremely talented cast a deeply interesting plot and idea a score of music that ties the whole film together with a perfect bow and stunning and incredibly realistic visuals that make you seriously wonder if you are in the movie with mcconaughey. speaking of mcconaughey he and hathaway simply shine yet the rest of the cast does a phenomenal job making the movie a powerful piece acting wise. i suggest this movie to anyone and everyone and it is perhaps the best nolan film out there.,5
2021.05.22,10,this movie is outrageously brilliant in its concept and delivery. the concept is so intricate yet beautiful. this is one of the best pieces of art ever made.,3
2014.11.12,9,yup nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!! interstellar is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. its full of space adventure and breathtaking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the universe.  to realize nolans masterpiece it is better if polish our ideas about spacetime theory. we know space is defined in 3 dimensions and einstein in his theory of relativity uses time as the 4th dimension. but scientists in the movie realize that gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus gravity is designated to be the fifth dimension. it is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in time and space. in this movie a certain species referred as they has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is them who wants humans to save themselves. in the film various scientific and astronomical theories are used and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too. murphys law it is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as anything that can go wrong will go wrong. a statement relating possibilities with certainty. worm hole it is a bridge a hypothetical topological feature of spacetime that would fundamentally be a shortcut through spacetime. a wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends each in separate points in spacetime. though undiscovered some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies. black hole it is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything including light from escaping. the boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. inside the hole what happens is still a mystery and thats where nolans creativity brings about. the movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. but the way nolan has directed it you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. the graphics are no doubt marvelous. the cast did a stupendous job and . though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet it is well deserved as love has no rules and no dimensions. conclusion watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!,24
2014.11.12,10,similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers this is my first review. if it happens to be my last as well i wouldnt mind. this movie warrants a review. the night before seeing interstellar i had watched stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which may have been the best movie of its decadecentury as well. i was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of kubricks masterpiece and i was worried that seeing it so soon before interstellar would lead me to great disappointment in nolans film. fortunately this is not the case. interstellar lived up to kubricks odyssey and will be one of my favorite movies of all time. nolans movie certainly didnt surpass odyssey the two occupy a very different space no pun intended in my mind and in the annals of cinema. i can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a scifi film and they cause all others to pale in comparison. even the recently released and acclaimed gravity has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces another great pun.  without spoiling any of the film i would like to discuss some details that impressed me. the score is phenomenal the acting is powerful and the special effects are superb. but perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to kubricks odyssey which made the dualexperience even more significant. certain elements of the film reminded me of kubricks jupiter and beyond the infinite sequence the mysterious monoliths even the legendary hal9000. even with these slight similarities so much of the movie was different and in enough ways bolder such that interstellar feels incredibly fresh and original. christopher nolan cowrote and directed this film which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation. even with his hardtomatch lineup of prior successes this movie is a phenomenal standout. the runtime felt very appropriate and just like odyssey i was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points. please treat yourself to a theater experience of interstellar. if you love scifi if you love the realities of space and astronomy even if you only love great film making you will love this movie.,20
2023.01.16,10,well well... where to start?! this one stays in my heart and head for a lifetime. its been almost 9 years since the release of the film and still it gives me that emotion i felt in the movie theater for the the first time watching it especially on imax. christopher nolan delivered another instant classic with an unforgettably beautiful and touching soundtrack by hans zimmer. its a very deep and complex story but once you understand what youve just seen you realize how magnificent it is. somehow in a good way this movie changed my life and i am grateful for it! truly he best film ive ever watched or felt. p. s. im a film editor and someday i hope will work with nolan. ,11
2021.06.10,10,truly a masterpiece. one of my personal top 2 movies of all time. this movie is suspenseful makes you think afterwards is emotional contains all kinds of exciting twists has one of the greatest soundtracks i have ever heard.... i could go on and on...,4
2016.02.14,6,i was expecting to see an exciting scifi film which will keep you watching till the end due to its high rating but it was a disappointment.  it has several problems in no particular order. 1. the robots design is too simple and ugly. it was basically a square with a computer screen in it. if people can send spaceship beyond the moon shouldnt the robots have more functions? this ugly robot doesnt even have two hands. it cant really do anything other than talking.  2. the robots voice sounds just like matt damon. i thought that they want to save money so they just used the same actor. it made the film sounded cheap. 3. cooper the character didnt do anything scientific all of sudden he was flying a spaceship into the deep space? that didnt make sense. 4. lack of asians. in 2016 black people are protesting lack of diversity in oscar this film didnt have any asian faces in it. there are more asian scientists than blacks . this film failed to hire asian actors.,20
2022.02.08,10,one of my favorite movie of all time. an amazing mind boggling adventure that only christopher nolan could pull off. on top of that hans zimmers score is absolutely exceptional and one of my all time favourites. a great story too. nolan just did it again and can score another great film. a true masterpiece.,6
2014.11.22,7,i could not wait to find a cinema that showed this movie especially after two of my close friends went as far as to saying that it was beyond a doubt one of the best movies of all time. honestly i dont think its the case. it will be one of the top movies of the year but thats about it. christopher nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens every step of the way so we dont get lost. it becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point where anne hathaway says something along the lines of nothing is more powerful than love. please! get serious! on the positive side the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. probably better than gravity.  all in all considering the type of movies that get done these days interstellar is definitely one to watch.,11
2017.09.26,4,although the idea is simple and written 100 times in sf novels and short stories it could make a quite good space opera. it could be deep and wise. it could make people think. but no. it had to be wasted. the weakest point is not poor acting by the way mcconaughey really cant speak? i am not the best in the world in english but i know many native speakers who couldnt understand him talking awful music. even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. it is a forced painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic. it would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas so just a few of them. some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in imdb faq but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. i start with a biggest problem  in r. e. raspes baron munchausen the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out on his own hair. the earthmen in the movie do the same the humans from the future save their ancestors. but if the present people perish there are no future people to save them... the most simple paradox and yet they included it in the serious movie. and no naive explanations branches interpretations nonlinear timelines etc can make it wiser no matter how many times they use the word fractal. and if the future people exist they dont need to do anything do they?  the best plan from the future humans is to put in a past a wormhole 2 years flight from earth making it almost impossible to find and reach. then the earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. i would simply help the earthmen get a decent crops... a catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. how? during just several years? and all plants are dead? all animals? but humans survived? how? isnt it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? why nobody even tries to do anything?  why an antiscience education? a science never does any harm. only the politics and businessmen do using science. so it is not the science to be ostracized. a farmer drives his children to antiscience school fully equipped to bring a military drone down has a specially programmed computer antennas means to establish a connection etc.  a ghost communication is very implausible. does it really depend on gravity? even some waves oscillations would create observed effects on booksdust the gravity hardly could. barely legal nasa base hidden in a barn building a spaceship... funny. unsuccessfully looking for its best pilot in the world year after year... funny. the pilot accidentally finds them and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists  funny. the scientists are pilots old friends. and they just finished building a rocket. he has never seen this ship he is a farmer for 20 years now so will he fly it the only hope for humanity please? funny!  plan a and b. science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey and rise them to get humans can not rise a radish on earth nor perform a mri scan. please stop the stupid experts presentation how it works the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes just like the similar imbecile in the martian explaining the trivial maneuver around earth. what makes it even more pathetic the expert addresses his childish show to a engineer and best nasa pilot. ...and so on... i dont understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system on its planets the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep the frozen solid clouds in the air the antilogic movements of the ships the antilogic decisions of the crew... and so on... and at the end i and all the nearby watchers couldnt believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughters bookshelves. it was... it was... unspoken. and the future men felt that the best way of communication with present people is to shake the books in some girls bedroom. if you can move the book or a hand of the watch  that means you can move objects  you can take a pen and write as well. it is the same action using the same forces. yes i fully understand the meanings metaphors 11 dimensions of continuum and so on. doesnt help. to sum up interstellar is just another pseudosciencefiction movie. it is intended to be deep and serious but is just funny including its makers argumentation why it is not. it is not easy to think out a good sf story. you can easily make a nonscience fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch like star wars but it cannot pretend it is serious and sciencebased. the most depressing thing about that movie is however its huge overrating on imdb. are the young people so easy to control? if they see something that makes the first impression of having some value slow grave pseudointellectual they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deepthinking? is that why poor sf movies get such a high notes? passengers the last few aliens and so on? my 4 rating is a real one not lowered to balance the general overrating.,78
2022.01.13,9,christopher nolans interstellar is one of the best 21st centuries films. it greatly depicts the struggle where humans must find a suitable place for their population to continue when the planet earth becomes no longer habitable while simultaneously making the viewer think to fully understand the story of interstellar. hans zimmer has created the most breathtaking and suitable music for this film arguably one of the best pieces of his career. the writing and visualization of the characters is superior to every other movie that i have seen. interstellar writing is impeccable because like some of the best written pieces the story leaves the viewer to think and shows only what is necessary to understand the story. the movie is capable of showing the struggle that is to find a habitable place for human race. it is so because wherever they look it turns out to not be survivable. the soundtrack written by hans zimmer manages to suck the viewers inside of the story making the audience feel almost as they are between one the main characters and feel the emotions going through them. it can show tension when there is one and showing fear when there is fear. all that just by the power of sound. truly remarkable. nevertheless this movie can show emotions almost like no other. in the scene where cooper returns to the main ship and views all the videos and messages that his family has sent him through the years he didnt live he experiences many different emotions. christopher nolan can make the audience experience these emotions. in conclusion this is a film that stands out between the best of films. by making the viewer think experience the emotions of characters while listening to one of the best movie soundtracks interstellar has to be placed in the list of best 21st century movies.,16
2022.01.21,10,this movie is breathtaking its wonderful in all respects the acting was the best the script was i cant imagine better than it the direction was amazing in christopher nolans wonderful way the visual effects and sound effects were great and the soundtrack by hans zimmer was very great.,1
2018.08.18,10,no matter if you can understand this movie regarding science.the love between cooper and murph is the key.and the promise of a father,3
2022.06.21,10,this film will flip your world upside down turn it twist it throw it across a baseball field and flip it back. it will change the way you look at reality and take you on an emotion rollercoaster ride as you do. one of the better films ive ever seen. a nearly flawless movie with superb acting and visuals.,4
2024.12.01,10,this is my first review and interstellar is the perfect film to start with. ive watched it 8 times and each viewing reveals something new. the visuals are stunning and the storys mix of science fiction and deep personal stakes makes it unforgettable. matthew mcconaugheys performance as cooper is truly emotional and the films atmosphere with hans zimmers incredible music really pulls you in. every time i watch it i find myself thinking about the universe and our place in it making it a film thats not just about what happens on screen but also what it leaves you thinking about afterward.,5
2020.11.04,10,it deserves much more..... it drove me crazy.....next level!!!!!!,3
2015.06.23,6,to explain my daring title  id like this review to be a counterbalance to many overenthusiast appraisals. yes it is a good actiondrama. yes it is a spectacular sciencefiction film. every genre fans dream travelling among different worlds though try to watch europa report! bending the laws of common sense newtonian physics and playing with blackholes and wormholes the spacebending explanation is just a shameless borrowing from much older event horizon. though this movie betrays the common sense in yet another way. its plot. we have destroyed this earth lets find another one. irresponsibility anyone? while we may argue  if this is not a premise of every beloved potapocalyptic distopia if space travel is not what we want from sciencefiction at the end of the day ... this movie dared to start with really hot topic so boldly that it should be judged by its own higher standards. so we have an ecosystem collapse in the beginning  it is quite obvious that the reason of it are monocultures stretching towards the horizon  a direct consequence of machist industrial technocratic approach to science progress planet life agriculture thinking... the root cause is so clearly visible in every picture frame of the downonearth part of the movie  but the only solution offered by the writers is again the technocratic one lets build super complex machines to transport us zillion light years away ... instead of simple ! cheap !! responsible !!! fixing of the darned monoculture issue down on our original planet. while many claim that this movie is sophisticated if not even intellectual  it is not  it is actually offensive to the intellect. there might be many of thegoodold space travel operas whom i would forgive this and spare them the common sense critique. but not interstellar  because it pretends that it is aware ecoconscious it pretends that it urges us to think about our relationship towards the planet but it fails exactly in this point. thinking. watch avatar and home instead.,22
2023.02.09,10,after more than 10 years have passed since watching this masterpiece i finally write a review about this incredible film that still leaves me moved by the whole story marvelling at all the scifi details. i do it while listening to the soundtrack which is also unique and legendary. we are very small compared to all the things we know and think we know! about the entire universe. this film gave me the same feeling of humility curiosity and fascination that i had the first time i saw a film of the same genre which was the one starring jodie foster and the same matthew mcconaughey a bow and tribute to my old favourite film in the scifi genre contact more than justly replaced in 1st place by interstellar.,5
2016.10.31,7,christopher nolen rides again with this massive scale sciif journey story that braids cutting edge special effects amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the years landmark films. the movie stars matthew mcconaughey as cooper a nasa astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earths natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. as cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanitys final throws a team of scientists headed by nolen favorites michael caine anne hathaway and david gyasi put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable worlds beyond our galaxy and require coopers skill to get them there. i really dug the hell out of this movie. as a fan of space travel myself i really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. its clear that the nolen brothers christopher and jonathen did their homework while writing this script. the performances are also quite good here and jessica chastaine who plays coopers grownup daughter is especially impressive. these things married with the imax scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. perhaps the thing i had the most problem with was the films third act. the movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001 a space odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say were smarter than that cmon what do you take us for? only to give in and end it that way anyway. at first i was ok with it but the more that i look at the film the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say really disappointing. overall i still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act i recommend it and if you can spring for the imax because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! no television could ever do it justice. this film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and its well deserved. if you love liked gravity or 2001 a space odyssey or apollo 13 you are sure to like this too. interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5.,20
2014.11.25,5,im disappointed. nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. this is one heck of a summer pop corn movie ill give it that. but its not much more than that and it has perhaps the worst sound design ive heard in 20 years. nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted  really loud with dialog thats hard to hear. to make it more immersive apparently. but if i want immersive i can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. what i want when i go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. and his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. and the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. meh. getting old chris. old. and by the end of the movie so were the endless references to 2001. sheesh. a good amusement park ride yes it is. but its still considerably below the bar set by gravity last year.,17
2023.05.06,10,the best and most exciting drama and exciting movies in the world of cinema are often directed by christopher nolan and interstellar also belongs to the same category of films. this film which i also offer to you tells a story full of excitement and drama along with brain and fascinating topics. directed by christopher nolan in interstellar he has used beautiful music and rich images to describe the story. in this film a world is depicted in which everything is different and attractive. following the amazing journey of this movie you can enjoy its great pleasure. in short interstellar directed by christopher nolan is one of the best and most exciting drama and exciting films to be offered for any cinema interested. the best part of this film is not only its beautiful and attractive images but also the deep concepts that are expressed will take you to another world.,7
2022.08.19,10,the story is so confusing for a normal audience but if u keep your mind intact through out the movie especially the climax part you will be blown out the thought process of the movie.,1
2022.01.21,10,i have seen it more than 5 times so far... i am a huge christopher nolan fan and this movie was his finest. i have never seen anything like it. one thing i would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space.,4
2023.02.11,9,i recently watched interstellar and it was truly an amazing experience! the visuals were spectacular and the story line kept me captivated throughout. the soundtrack was also incredibly beautiful and powerful adding to the overall atmosphere of the film. the acting especially from matthew mcconaughey was superb and added a great deal of emotion to the scenes. overall i highly recommend interstellar to anyone looking for an entertaining thoughtprovoking movie. interstellar was an amazing movie! it was gripping suspenseful and emotionally resonant. the visuals were stunning and the soundtrack was beautiful. every performance was top notch. the story was complex yet easy to follow and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. this movie is a mustwatch for any fan of science fiction. highly recommended!,12
2024.12.09,10,really good. chismis pointers 1. timeline  june nagbreak sila ni rico. nasa very dark place sya and very lonely and vulnerable. 2. anthony was very sweet to her. caring and talking sweet things and comforting her. 3. since the start na everyday sila magkatrabaho sinasabi ni anthony na single sya and since single din daw si maris that time she make patol. 4. sept 8. nagitaly sila and their relationship went deeper. and still anthony is confirming na single siya. birthday niya pauwi sila super caring parin ni anthony and thats why she did a my day to appreciate him. 5. halloween they went out public and they are sweet kase alam nya single si anthony but jam posted some my days and even without names alam niya ano yun. and the bashing started daw. 6. ilang beses daw nya inask si anthony and he gave her an assurance na single sya. and kinumusta niya si jam as per the screenshot because she is trying to just check jams wellbeing kasi alam nya na hinehelp sya ni anthony for some medical stuff. 7. ilang beses nya inask si anthony na magpublic statement na single sya like he always says kaso sabi ni anthony na he needs time and maris doesnt want to be pushy and agitate him. 8. she is sorry and dont want to play victim pero shes sorry sa public that we have to see her intimate side but she said thats what she is when is love or like someone. 9. she tried to reach out to jam to know whats up but didnt get any response and shes sorry for jam. but she said din nya talaga alam. 10. she made a mistake. she doesnt know how to move on from this. she said whenever she goes out she feels like a naked woman. and shes sorry to the people who supported her for the past 10 years. but she will continue to work and she is just a human being. bottomline si anthony may kasalanan. as per her. kim garcia fttm.,36
2024.12.10,10,hans zimmers mesmerizing score hans zimmers score is another highlight blending haunting organ compositions with moments of silence that amplify the vastness and isolation of space. the music enhances the emotional intensity of the story making every scene more impactful. themes of love and survival at its core interstellar is not just about space exploration its about the resilience of the human spirit the power of love and the sacrifices were willing to make for the future. the relationship between cooper and murph is the heart of the narrative grounding the cosmic scale of the story with deeply personal stakes.,4
2019.03.08,7,the vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. this movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.,3
2025.02.03,10,my number one alltime favorite movie. i just saw the 10th anniversary edition in imax and wow. it still blows me away. everything about this film just works for me. the story is epic spanning vast distances of space and time yet its also deeply personal. it explores big questions about humanitys place in the universe our survival instinct and the very nature of time itself. seeing the vastness of space on the massive imax screen was breathtaking. the planets the galaxies the black hole  all rendered with such incredible detail and realism. it truly feels like youre journeying alongside the characters experiencing the wonder and the terror of the unknown. the sound design is equally impressive creating a truly immersive and visceral experience. from the rumbling of the rocket launches to the eerie silence of deep space the soundscape perfectly complements the visuals. but what truly elevates interstellar for me is its emotional core. the relationship between cooper and murph is the heart of the film and its what makes the story so emotionally resonant. interstellar isnt just a science fiction movie its a movie about hope about love and about the enduring power of the human spirit. it reminds us that even in the face of overwhelming odds we are capable of extraordinary things. its a film that stays with you long after the credits have rolled prompting you to ponder your own place in the universe and the connections that matter most.,16
2021.10.12,6,a movie that starts out very strong great acting and a great storyline that seemed to deteriorate halfway through.,1
2014.11.07,1,it is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be brainy   intelligent well written... with all the things i read about the   movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment ive   experienced from cinema in years. i give 1 star to bring balance to the   current rating in reality this movie is of course not that bad.    the whole idea behind the plot is that mcconaughey ended up in this   blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and   stuff and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his   daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. so what   in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of   events mcconaughey ended up inside this blackhole. all this was   apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. was there really no   easier way for future humansaliens to transmit this data and if   they built this timespace warping machine inside the blackhole  means   they had access to the data all along? and also means they chose   mcconaughey daughter on purpose? so i dont understand what was this   purpose? could they not have connected their portal to professors   office a long time ago or go for one of the ten billion more rational   alternatives?    on a side note is it not funny how mcconaughey ignored the message not   to go from the same ghost yet followed the rest of the directions?   while in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble   attempt. had he added its you dad or any other sensible hint he   would have saved his daughter years of suffering and maybe a lifetime   for himself when he realises this. and i dont even want to get into   how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on   the watch which was unaffected after being picked up meaning it was   hardly gravitational manipulation was it? what was the point of trying   to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. if he could   do that he ought to have found a better solution that did not require   his daughter 25 years to figure out.    and anyway they saved humanity by building this massive station named   after his daughter by that time they knew what he went through and   they still named it after her?. why couldnt they have done the same   thing on earth? just build the same goddamn station on earth without   needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsht bam humanity   saved in the same way.    grand ideas dont make great movies if you cant deliver them   properly... it is atrocity to compare this to kubricks masterpiece...,21
2022.08.24,10,christopher nolans interstellar incorporates space family and loss to create a powerful film. although science fiction the movie comes across realistic with no sound being used in outer space. through christophers imagination we was able to see a depiction of the unsolved mystery of what is in a black hole one of matthew mcconaughey best performances surprised we havent seen more of mackenzie foy given her how great she played young murph. this is my favourite scifi film and in my top 5 films ever made.,4
2024.12.07,10,interstellar is out of doubt one of the greatest and most beautiful stories ever told or put to screen. the level of humanity this movie offers is astonishing. the movie is about a father who travels trough space in order to save his family by finding a new home for mankind because of earth has been heavily polluted and does not longer have the capacity to sustain human life. the protagonist the father named cooper is then forced to make the hard choice to either leave his family in order to have a chance of saving them or live with them until the end. he chooses to go out and save them and the movie is all about this dilemma and how this affects himself and especially his daughter murph. the movie later presents a lot of interesting themes and dilemmas involving the characters choices and the plot itself. family and humanity is in focus throughout the whole story with love and struggle to reunite with loved ones. according to myself the ending of interstellar is one of the most emotional and heartbreaking endings of all time. and its also one of the most satisfying and built up. the whole movie is a journey and it builds up to this bittersweat end that leave the audience fulfilled and possibly teared up. lastly interstellar is one of the most meaningful movies about humanity as a specie and about a father and daughter story. its one of the greatest movies of all time and the best movie of the 21st century and is 10 years later still as important and will forever be important as a great movie about mankind and the love we feel for each others.,12
2024.12.16,10,i need 70mm imax in my life forever i need to watch every movie in this format. anyways interstellar was amazing took my dad to see it with me and it was his first time and he was mind blown even tho i saw this before i was still avoiding spoilers and the sound was incredible and the scene where hes driving away from his kids and the rocket lunchs i got goosebumps everywhere  and the screen was huge it sucks i was in the second row but it was still amazing but there was some scenes where the bass was very high it was blocking out the things the characters were saying and my ears blow up but other then that sound was incredible and the graphics amazing old school 70mm had the old style in a new look and cinematography was amazing like it always was and i was holding back tears during that scene were he was looking at the messages from his kids dam. if monday wasnt sold out i would definitely go again. 1010 and btw i started the clapping at the end so im now  cinematography 1010 story 1010 acting 910 sad scenes 1010 comedy 710 action 810 sound 1010 some scenes 610 effects 1010 looks 1010.,4
2022.06.24,10,i cried like a baby. i love christopher nolan. i love the batman movies and memento was awesome. interstellar is worth seeing! highly recommend. go see it if you like christopher nolan and space. really cool.,7
2020.09.09,10,interstellar is the most powerful movie i have ever watched before. this experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. a brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think performances that can drive you to tears editing that feels out of this world and above all else a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. the drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist per se although matt damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen but instead from the simple concept of time. the writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific and i would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. so many of the scenes are masterfully laid out and can be so dramatic. one of the best scenes is when cooper is leaving and murph runs to her father crying only to find that hes not staying for her even after she told him to go. this film is even more powerful later on when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf telling him to stay was actually cooper in the future. as the music builds cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented and he would have seen his daughter grow up but now he will never be able to do that. this is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life for everybody elses life. learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist and watching the betrayal on murphs face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. matthew mcconaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film and he seems so genuine of a person that its hard not to feel bad for him. every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good even down to the minor characters. the twists in this movie are beautifully done and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could. what absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by hans zimmer. every piece of music is intense tearjerking and unequivocally beautiful. this movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. how on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me. this is the greatest science fiction movie i have ever seen in my life and this is certainly christopher nolans magnum opus.,19
2022.06.01,10,i thoroughly enjoyed this and the music was spot on. i felt it was really different to the usual stuff of the genre and the storyline remained interesting though out.,2
2021.11.28,6,amazing visuals and an epic feeling overall but the film itself is a overly long and moves too slow at times. matthew mcconaughey is very good in it though!,2
2020.10.31,10,now this is what i call science fiction. i had been waiting for so long for a movie like this before it finally came out. its a masterpiece. unforgettable soundtrack stunning visuals tense action scenes touching story that always make me cry like a baby. and space. this movie is everything a space geek is looking for. many years have passed and no movie can surpass the emotions this one gave me. thats why its still my number one. maybenotsointerestingfact scientists consider this movie to be very scientifically accurate in many points. but its still science fiction. so enjoy!,11
2014.11.03,6,interstellar marks christopher nolans return to the silver screen since ending his dark knight trilogy. while interstellar seems like classic nolan it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. and it most certainly seems this way. interstellar has the best effects that ive ever seen in a film. each shot detailing the vacancy of space and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. while that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has it also doesnt delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding nolans story and its characters. the story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. while spoon feeding the audience isnt exactly nolans forte it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. but as nolan intended this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early stanley kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. christopher nolan can certainly deliver us a great film his filmography speaks for itself but interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. their characters are there strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours it certainly does drag in certain scenes. however despite it feeling long and bloated the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. the technical aspects of this film are extraordinary. everything from the beautiful flawless cinematography to the robust sound design everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. it makes for a truly engrossing theater experience if nothing else. overall interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while i didnt love the film outright theres a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.,19
2014.11.08,3,feeling very disappointed given all the hype and rave reviews. what a bunch of utter pseudoscientific crap! the socalled scientific advisors must live in a parallel universe with completely different laws of nature. the characters are as flat as twodimensional entities. the only realistic holes are not wormholes nor black holes but the gaping holes in the storyline. how come hollywood these days always seems to take fascinating science fictionthemes and mangle them into some commercial junk that is all about fiction and has not the slightest thing to do with science? kubricks 2001 a space odyssey is still light years ahead of the rest of the pack almost 50 years since that brilliant film was created. dont waste your money on this farce but buy a good book instead and create your own spacetime adventure on your comfortable couch at home.,8
2025.05.23,10,honestly interstellar is the best movie ive ever seen. it completely blew my mind. the story the visuals the emotionsits on a whole other level. from the very beginning i was hooked. its not just about space or science its about love time sacrifice and what it means to be human. matthew mcconaugheys performance as cooper felt so real. you could feel every emotion he went throughespecially the connection with his daughter. that fatherdaughter bond hit me hard. and dont even get me started on the soundtrack by hans zimmer. that music gave me chills. it made every moment feel 10 times more intense. visually the movie is stunning. the way they showed the black hole the planets the spaceshipit all looked so real and so beautiful. its one of those movies that makes you feel small like youre just a tiny part of something way bigger than yourself. and the ending? wow. i didnt expect to feel that emotional in a scifi movie but interstellar isnt just scifiits something deeper. it makes you think and it stays with you long after it ends. if you havent watched it yet seriously do it. its not just a movieits an experience.,20
2019.10.13,10,this is the first and maybe last review ill ever write. im writing it after seeing this movie for the third time and i feel that im ready to say that this it the best scifi movie of all time. if cinema is to be included among the arts then this is a timeless masterpiece to cherish and nolan is the michelangelo of this industry. yes.... i like this movie quite a lot....,5
2024.12.09,10,this movie is quite moving worth the watch.years later sometimes i just need to see the start. or end. or a trailer. or the music and theme from hans zimmer. or the whole movie. just to feel that thing i only get from this movie. that the earth space and time are something special mystical. i never forget the first time i saw this movie in an imax theatre in 2014. i was struck by it. totally got me. and it stil does 7 years later. this is the best movie ever made for me. because of the feeling it gives me no other movie can. so hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. brilliant.,16
2020.10.31,10,i love this film it has great acting and screenplay combined with great visuals and fantastic storytelling.,1
2024.12.09,10,awesome film! awesome film! i hope you understand it and i will complete it with you in the morning if so much for you i will be able to your account details and i will complete your payment and send it back to you so the transaction payment will automatically be received on your account so you can to receive the payment successfully immediately you 8 receive the your payment payment immediately you receive your deposit immediately 8 8 your payment payment immediately your payment payment immediately 8 the payment immediately you 7 receive your payment immediately immediately you receive your payment.,3
2023.02.08,10,this movie is the most beautiful creative realistic and emotional movie that i have ever seen. i genuinely believe that this movie is the most perfect movie ever. this movie has everything love betrayal suspense mystery action happiness and connection. this movie is just done so well. the plot is so well written. it is very hard to stop watching this movie. the casting is amazing. the acting is over the top. i am starting to think that matthew mcconaughey is one of the best actors ever. the vfx are a beauty and the characters? dont get me started. the dialogue is written in such a mysterious but realistic way. i am in love with this movie. this is also a very long movie and i do think that it is a bit of a headache but i would be lying if i said that my mind wasnt blown because it was! i dont think i will ever see another movie. 1010. you have to watch this movie!,17
2022.03.28,6,quite boring. the characters werent believable. the plot had some thrilling bits and the cinematography was nice. at one point for a brief moment they imply that if humans got the opportunity to build a perfect world exactly to their liking it would look like a 1970s american suburb. thats the level of insight this film is working with.,5
2018.09.28,10,wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful,1
2022.03.27,6,is mumbling great acting? seems like hathaway and mcconaughey mumble the entire movie. its almost as if the dialog in this movie isnt really meant to be fully understood. not much about this film can be easily understood because it doesnt make a whole lot of sense. lots of cheap sentimentalism. i love science but i find this a middling mildly interesting movie not worth its recognition.,6
2024.04.07,10,in my view this movie is a masterpiece in every way with outstanding music professional acts especially matthew mcconaughey dealing with scientific facts and explaining points most simply and understandably for the audience. this movie has attracted me so much that im willing to watch it again more than ten times and not get enough. during the movie my mind kept going back and forth between scientific facts and human emotions to the point where i often felt like i was related to the characters and got involved in the story. i recommend interstellar to all scientific and drama movie lovers. i dont use the word scifi i think interstellar did its best to stay away from fiction.,5
2020.11.04,10,i have seen many scifi movies in my life. but this is the best scifi movie i have ever seen. all the scenes and storyline is just the best. i have no words to describe this movie.,4
2015.11.25,9,im a big fan of anything scifi and ive always been interested in the boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. while most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often prioritize the fi over the sci interstellar is one of those rare gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly entertaining movie. any doubts i had going into the film about a dramatic scifi being directed by christopher nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie and its tremendous score began. while nolan excelled with the prestige and inception they did leave something to be desired and i was fresh off the batman trilogy bandwagon. but nolan excels yet again directing the film with such confidence and control that its almost impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. each and every aspect of his signature style is also prominently visible through the film. continue reading the review at my blog below httpsmicroreels.wordpress.com20151125interstellarfilm review,9
2022.08.13,10,this is a masterpice nothing else to say it is perfect to the beginning to the end the plot the cinematography and the actors everything i mean for me is the best film i ever watched.,1
2025.03.15,8,the three things i love most about this film the visuals the soundtrack and matthew mcconaugheys performance. the sight of space with earth in the distance made me feel both lost and deeply moved. hans zimmers cornfield chase elevated that emotion to another level. the moment cooper shed tears was the moment i did too. i thought about my father about my childhood cousin whom i was close to about my loved ones. strangely i thought about family while watching this film. though interstellar carries many profound meanings for me the most important thing about a movie is its ability to immerse the audience in emotions. and interstellar did just that.,8
2026.01.03,10,the best three hours ive ever spent in front of a screen ive watched this movie more than seven times and it still impresses me every time it is completely free of explicit scenes profanity alcohol and weapons yet it deserves a 10 out of 10 rating a true masterpiece matthew performance is absolutely stunning the script is brilliant and the film speaks to both the heart and the mind the soundtrack is enchanting moving powerful and unforgettable this movie stays with you long after its over and you will feel a strange unforgettable sensation after watching it finally i recommend watching it in a suitable atmosphere with a cup of coffee full focus and patience.,1
2014.11.27,6,mediocre acting overuse of dialog to explain the backstory and fakecontrived science. its like whoever wrote the script is some enlightened metaphilosopher re psychedelic substance userwith an overgeneralized and topical understanding of astrophysics. most people that have enjoyment studying astrophysics will be horribly annoyed watching a bunch of actors blabbering and playing experts...if you know a little about astrophysics you will find it cringeworthy. matthew mcconaughey was miscast he doesnt have a believable character in this one...same with hathaway. they both come across as if they dont even believe the sincerity of their own lines  the dialog is very weird and almost forced at times especially with bizarre outofplace technical andor scientific jargon that would never be brought up among expert colleagues i.e. nolan overusing dialog to inform the dumb audience about the background science  its less of a story and more of a writer trying to forcefeed their own gnarly philosophies to whom they must deem a dull and uninformed audience. it could have been a lot more but nolan chose to sit on the fence as far as what type of scifi it would be whether fantastical or realistic. so wheres all the hype from? the liberal media that cant help but interject politics into everything...the idea of an earth uninhabitable conforms with their worldviews about climate change so they completely overlook the actual film itself. overall very boring... if youre looking for star wars star trek serenity etc...look elsewhere...if youre looking for a recent watchable scifi im usually not a fan of tom cruises movies but his last scifi edge of tomorrow wasnt half bad...at least better than oblivion.,18
2020.09.06,10,this film here made three hours feel like a walk in the park by the amount of attention it i gave to it. from the opening scene to the credits my full attention was on the screen.,2
2015.04.02,6,this movie has achieved a very high rating on imdb and so i had a very high level of expectation before seeing it. my one concern was that ive found nolans recent work particularly inception to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. i found interstellar to suffer from the same faults. very interesting ideas great cinematography solid cast although i wish matthew mcconaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. he doesnt seem to have fully recovered from his role in true detective and i couldnt understand what he was saying much of the time and i was not alone in this. a number of reviewers have used the word epic to describe this movie. id be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. a friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from earth to saturn and when you see interstellar it feels like youre making the same trip! an exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. not all bad news however  some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources  obviously 2001 2010 and arthur c clarkes story rendezvous with rama. definitely worth seeing but i dont share the masterpiece line of some reviewers. good but not great.,12
2014.11.08,5,christopher nolan has made some great films but alas this isnt one of them. its not a bad film but as scifi it misses the target. a film about alien life forms is credible because its possible but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data time and five dimensions that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe whats going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. and then in what seemed like an eternity later in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. also im still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. particularly distracting was when he rose from the pod. maybe if id known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it but it came across as an unintended joke. and the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. reportedly costing 165 million to make the money sure doesnt show up on the screen. for all the questionable raves about the effects among other things i wasnt wowed by them at all. a dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. visually it was no oblivion. the relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. as i said its not a bad film. without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch scifi from a great film maker it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention largely because the actors threw their all into it and because hans zimmers great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. heres hoping mr. nolan gets back on track next time out.,17
2024.12.15,10,amongst the best movies of all time. the story the acting the script the cinematography the effects the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 1010s. but what beats all of that is hans zimmers compositions. how he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing. amongst the best movies of all time. the story the acting the script the cinematography the effects the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 1010s. amongst the best movies of all time. the story the acting the script the cinematography the effects the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 1010s.,8
2021.01.02,10,the best movie i ever saw and i watched hundreds off them from godfather pulp fiction the green mile the pianist schindlers list,1
2024.12.08,10,watching interstellar was nothing short of an extraordinary journey that left me in awe long after the credits rolled. directed by christopher nolan this film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema taking us on a profound voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning as it is intellectually stimulating. from the moment interstellar begins you are thrust into a future earth on the brink of ecological collapse. the desperation and urgency are palpable setting the stage for an epic quest to save humanity. what struck me immediately was the films ability to blend grandiose science fiction with deeply personal storytelling. the relationship between cooper played masterfully by matthew mcconaughey and his daughter murph is the emotional heart of the film grounding the cosmic adventure in a relatable human experience.,6
2021.08.27,10,i wanted to see this on the large screen so badly when it was coming to theaters but nobody in my immediate sphere could see it with me. so on an afternoon in december i say all by myself in the theater to see it in the middle of the day with almost nobody around me. probably for the best considering how badly i bawled my eyes out in various parts of it. firstly the characters both principal and ancillary are all played with great effectivity by all the people involved. you care about these people. not just because the represent hope for the species but because of how vested they are in mission success and in each other. you even care about tars as well for goodness sakes and hes a robot but i cared about data and bishop too so theres that. the story was paced as well as it could be considering how much story there was to tell in only 2 hours 40 minutes. second if you watch it the first time its a science fiction movie about survival humanity time space family etc. when you watch it from the vantage point about it being a fatherdaughter movie it completely changes the tenor of things and makes it all that more emotional of an experience in addition to being a visually compelling one. once i relayed this to my own experience as a father to a daughter of my own my empathy level for cooper went off the charts and catapulted this film into one of my favorites of all time. lastly and i think most importantly  the score. oh good great goodness hans zimmer has been a favorite of mine since i bought the broken arrow soundtrack in my high school years. but this is probably his masterpiece. the breath of the billowing organ thrust against the ambient dissonant and sometimes harmonious synthesizer work brings this sense of our organic essence in relief to the machinery that is thrusting us into space and enabling us to achieve greatness as our earth is failing us. this score is only more captivating with further listening and you will remember everything you felt in those moments without a single image in front of you. a great movie delivered by an epic score. its everything i want in the film experience.,18
2020.09.17,10,i had a special interest in science since my childhood. i tried to read all the scifi related books. during the shutdown i watched a lot of movies as well as a lot of documentaries on science. when i heard that my favorite director christopher nolan directed a movie in astrophysics i was shocked. i watched it as soon as possible. honestly i will not skimp on rating 1010 in each of directionactingscorecinematography. moreover it is only possible for nolan to get impossible details in the necessary places accuracy as well as not to drag complex science in unnecessary places or take the help of fiction in the interest of the movie. i missed some key points without seeing the problem of sound mixing and without subtitles for which i see it again in print the next day seeing it properly i realized that nolan has created a masterpiece! it will be more enjoyable to watch the movie as a drama without trying to understand it as scifi. because human emotion has been given priority in many cases here. even in some cases nolan has ignored science in the interests of the drummer. so in the end interstellar is more of a drama than a scifi which conveys a more beautiful message about love than many romantic movies. of all the powerful dialogues in the whole movie this one seems to me to be the best. not to mention the soundtrack of the movie. some music plays with peoples emotions at the same time can bring different kinds of feelings can put pressure on the nerves. one such score is interstellar music by oscarwinning composer hans zimmer who has previously worked with nolan on inception the dark knight and you must remember what a terribly beautiful creation the music track was. interstellars cast made me even more excited about it. while immersed in the true character of true detective matthew appeared in the role of cooper along with one of my favorites anne hathaway and mackenzie foy but even if you havent seen mackenzie foy before you can imagine that this box of cuteness will grow into another jessica chastain! it also seems wrong to expect nolans movie to be simple linear. interstellar seems to me parallel nonlinear although i doubt if there is anything with this name. something happens before and some happens at the same time. an attempt was made to describe the incident linearly. people reach a stage where they have to be developed from 4 dimensional being to 5 dimensional being. 5d sees time as a dimension so they can navigate at any time. these 5 dimensional human beings are they! but time is also a physical dimension for 5d. its like you can see all the events laid out in front of you you can see your birth your school life your marriage your death ... as long as humans are 5d the earth is destroyed so they are located in another galaxy. but if they come to this other galaxy it will take a way that was not discovered until the earth was destroyed. wormholes are a type of quantum anomaly. at the quantum level it is seen that electrons can move from one place to another without passing any time. this concept is called wormhole. if the wormhole could be created in the form of a mass it would be possible to pass two lightyears apart almost any time apart. it is not possible to create wormholes naturally due to the huge amount of energy and dark energy required to keep them warm and stable. but 5d people have found a way to stabilize wormholes. this time they created a wormhole and placed one end of the wormhole near saturn in our solar system the other end in the galaxy where future humans will be. so this time we need to transfer the people of the world to a new place. for this they choose murph k. murphys father cooper is a nasa engineer and pilot and murphy is exceptionally intelligent. from morphs bookshelf comes the morse code signal stay which is sent by murphys father cooper a 5d tesseract created by future 5d human. because the first time cooper enters tesseract he thinks hes stuck here forever and nothing would have happened if past cooper hadnt been on this mission. then cooper realizes the power of tessaract. tessaradact is a 5d model so he can navigate at any time. grace received the necessary information about the singularity for the gravity equation solve from tarsus black hole which he was converting to cooper for morse and sending to cooper murph controlling the second hand of the clock. if spacetime is continuous multiverse we can never see another universe but gravitational pull. thats why cooper uses gravity for contact. data from singularity from murph cooper and data from romleys black hole all solve the gravity equation which was started by professor brand. it is through the gravity equation that the massive cooper station and the people of the world begin their journey from the earth to the human new home to use gravity. meanwhile as soon as cooper murphy finishes sending all the info needed for gravity equation the purpose of the tesseract is fulfilled and the 5d closes the tesseract and sends cooper and tarsus back to saturn with a wormhole. the first handshake as cooper crosses the wormhole the rangers found and rescued cooper as he passed saturn at marfra cooper station. suffice it to say wormholes are so far only possible at the quantum level. although the black hole was discovered no information was found inside its event horizon. the tesseract part of the ending is completely fiction even if it doesnt say may be 5 dimensions so far only in theory. string theory also speaks of 9 dimensions. but so far nothing has been scientifically proven. maybe they will answer these questions.,56
2020.12.08,10,this movie will teach you about beauty of time and science,1
2017.03.24,6,interstellar is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. going into this movie everybody would have expected an extremely well made visually beautiful spectacle and thats what you get. however everything else about the film is a disappointment. sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun unless of course youre watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. throughout interstellar i found my mind wandering and i must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. the film just isnt sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time. whilst visually impressive interstellar is void of fun. in fact its void of anything that will make you change your expression. this is just one long pretentious and selfimportant film that isnt anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest.,9
2024.12.12,10,captivating. intense. breathtaking. why did it take me 10 years to watch it. they do not make movies like this anymore. a nolan masterpiece. shout out to zimmer on the song track complimented every scene perfectly. this is a film you can watch over and over again. the imagery when they entered the sphere by saturn was amazing with the first hand shake. couldnt have done it any better. when dr mann decided go rouge and blew up the station was a great scene the silence after was deafening. amazing performance from matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway were brilliant. complimented each other well and drew us into the characters straight away.,13
2014.11.10,7,i was really looking forward to watching some decent scifi and when i was this was on at the local regal cinemas i decided to check it out. jumped on imdb quick and was shocked to see it had a 9.3 rating at that time...maybe it was a mistake to look at the rating it may have pushed my expectations too high. i was expecting something over the top good and it just wasnt. the movie could have used more technology and more serious thinking and dialog. the revelation at the end i saw coming probably in the first 30 minutes of this nearly 3 hour movie. there are some good and exciting moments and there are definitely scenes that have the cool factor but it is not a 9.0 movie. i give it a solid 7. it seems a lot of people enjoyed the movie a lot more than me and that is great but this is my opinion of it.,11
2025.03.17,4,i dont know what i expected apparently i never read the synopsis or watched a trailer i watched it simply based on hype from others. im so tired of endoftheworld movies and shows. i either didnt realize or thought this one would be better than the others but it wasnt. im sure my bias played a big role in why i had a hard time looking this movie. so for that i feel its impossible to give a fair rating but the app forces me to put a rating so im putting it in the middle. other than my recognized bias is hard for me to pinpoint why i didnt enjoy this movie. im no cinema expert so cant articulate well what things i didnt like. one possibility a good movie should fully engage you pull you into the world theyve created and allow you to suspend disbelief. this movie did not do that. i was questioning things almost the entire time. another possible reason is the pacingediting of the movie just felt weird at times. i dont know how to explain it better. i understand theres a lot of time jumps but the way it was done didnt pull me into the story. the first half of the movie had me bored. the middle started to amp up and there was a twist i actually wasnt expecting and i thought it might have a better ending. but then the twist at the end just made me cringe and there was no way i was going to like this movie by the end. i just dont see what all the hype was about this movie. was it terrible? no. was it worth watching? maybe? will i watch it again? no.,23
2019.03.12,10,i find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. chris nolan has set the bar higher than he did on inception. the story is based on probable science  with help from kip thorne. the cast is perfect. matthew mcconaughy as the former pilot and everyman who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. nolan regular michael caine  jessica chastain  timothee chalamet and anne hathaway round out the main cast. the surprise packet is young mackenzie foy whos daughter father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. the robot tars was my favourite character in the film. he was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost. hans zimmers score maybe the best hes ever done! pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score i can remember. through the nearly 3 hours i was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. its hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers. i laughed  cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. an instant 1010 that gets better on viewing. i cant stress how much i recommend this film. drop what youre doing!!,18
2024.12.11,10,interstellar is a bold and ambitious film that pushes the boundaries of science fiction while delivering a deeply human story. though not without flaws it is a visually and emotionally unforgettable experience. for those who appreciate thoughtprovoking cinema and are willing to embrace its complexities interstellar is a masterpiece that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. 1. visual mastery nolan collaborates with cinematographer hoyte van hoytema to deliver some of the most aweinspiring visuals in cinematic history. the depiction of wormholes black holes scientifically informed by physicist kip thorne and alien planets are as breathtaking as they are grounded in theoretical science. 2. hans zimmers score zimmers organheavy soundtrack is haunting and majestic perfectly capturing the vastness of space and the intensity of human emotion. the music is as essential to the films identity as its visuals. 3. emotionally driven storytelling at its core interstellar is about the enduring bonds of love particularly between a father and daughter. mcconaugheys heartfelt performance anchors the film and jessica chastain shines as the grownup murphy. 4. ambitious themes the film tackles big ideas like the survival of the species the nature of time and gravity and the resilience of the human spirit. it doesnt shy away from challenging its audience intellectually and emotionally.,15
2021.11.01,9,the movie is a true masterpiece. from the advanced renderings of the galaxy to the soundtrack everything in this movie is just mind blowingly good. the details like a distant ticking noise that happens in the background every 1.25 seconds on millers planet means one day passes on earth. these details is what makes this movie but not on its own. get comfortable and pay attention to everything you will not regret watching this.,6
2021.05.22,10,wish i could see this in the theater. the scoring is a masterpiece. this is one of the best scoring in cinema. and how nolan told us about the 5th dimensions is simple yet outstanding with remarkable visual that leave the viewer speechless. at least thats what i felt. no doubt this is my favorite movie of all time.,6
2020.08.21,10,there are no words to describe this masterpiece. i just remember back in 2014 having watched it 7 times at cinema! i wanted to enjoy every moment interstellar was running.,3
2021.09.11,10,tars its not possible. cooper no its necessary.,2
2015.04.20,6,if the underlying logic is missing the story overly simplistic and weak then spending 160 million on production isnt going to make it a great movie. the potential is huge but the end result feels lacking. this may well could have been a real masterpiece with a bit more thoughtfulness and work. it has some interesting science wrapped around a meager plot.  it may well have sky high ambitions very good production value actors and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. it lacks even the most basic logic. how this can be considered as intelligent and philosophical is beyond me. the science is heavily dumbeddown and simplified presumably to appeal to a wide audience. the overall script is extremely simplistic. the philosophical aspect shallow and empty. the whole is wrapped into a fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience. matt damon gives his worst performance to date blame the script. anne hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place. matthew mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games the only thing missing is the occasional yeahaaaa! like a cowboy. i applaud the ambition but overall its a mess. a mess with silver linings. but still worth the watch.,18
2018.09.25,10,science fiction can definitely lead to a bad film... i have names... but this film is the total opposite its simply a masterpiece. the storyline is excellent the actors are amazing mcconaughey is amazing they brilliantly play their part.  its incredibly moving... please thing about having a kleenex with you. its the story of a man who would die to save his children but as well for whom this life is not enough. his an explorer an adventurer a courageous man and a father. put all this is your shaker and you get one of the most moving film i have ever watched.  .. to be watched.. and watched....,11
2020.10.19,7,you already know whats good about the movie so lets look at the not so good its full of hamfisted plot points. arguably it starts off a fun causal loop which i tend to usually enjoy as plot devices. however it quickly devolves into to fairly poorly executed exposition tricks such as an engineer explaining to the pilot the very basics of the flight is just been selected for? or the very basic of gravity that any astronaut would know about??? why? you also have a scene in there where the lead takes down an indian military predator drone with only two young children a laptop and a pringle cantenna. so it would be rather wise of the people qualify this as being highbrow hard science fiction to eat a bit of humble pie as a lot of the story is no more intelligent than than say your average avengers movie. this isnt primer. regardless the direction and the photography are so brilliantly executed that its impossible not to give this movie at least a seven  rating simply for the camera work and the vfx. it is not however the 2001 killer some rave about and thats not necessarily a bad thing.,10
2017.08.24,5,interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. it interests me. how can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboyism and bandwagoning? for starters i would just like to say my opinion. i think the movie is fine. its a little too drawnout and has bizarre elements and i think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film. some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters and for them they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time. so how did nolan do it? well i believe he tapped into zeitgeist or the spirit of the times. he made a perfect storm of a movie using elements that on their own are not very special but combined they reflect the values of this age. lets break it down. first off space. the works of neil degrasse tyson and bill nye have fired up new interest in space and people loved the realistic take on the genre. second the message of love. western culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit. layer on top of this the cinematography direction and style of nolan which fanboys have been eating up since memento. and while i like almost all nolan films i think interstellar is his worst featuring nolanisms dialed up to 11 with philosophical stances on love life time destiny and humanitys position in the universe. everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose and there are reasons to like it. just please dont deny the fact that its pretentious overly long and contrived. recognize that but say that that didnt stop you from enjoying it.,21
2025.05.05,10, 1010  a scifi masterpiece thatll warp your soul  interstellar isnt just a movieits an emotional black hole that pulls you in and refuses to let go. nolan delivered a cinematic experience thats visually stunning scientifically ambitious and emotionally gutwrenching all at once. the mix of hard science with deep human emotion hits different. from the silence of space to the ticking timebomb of a planet where 1 hour equals 7 years every moment feels urgent massive and beautifully tragic. hans zimmers score? literal chills. mcconaugheys cry scene? iconic. murphs notebook? legendary. and the endingbittersweet hopeful and so nolan. whether youre in it for the space physics or the feels this is one of those rare films that leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. interstellar isnt just 1010. its timebending heartbreaking genredefining perfection. mustwatch forever.,15
2021.05.30,10,the very fact that this movies representation of image of black hole aligns perfectly with the 1st true image of the same tells you the lengths they went to make it both in tecnically  cinematically.,1
2024.12.09,10,to say this movie looks phenomenal is an understatement to say i believe its incredibly written is an understatement to say that this movie is a masterpiece is too little to describe it. interstellar is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. it perfectly captivated exactly what i believe cinema should be. its got spectacle great stakes amazing performances by all its actors and most importantly at the center of it heart a beautiful heartbreaking story of a father and daughter relationship at the very center of a movie filled with concepts that go beyond our comprehension. love is the one thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space this is one of the best lines ive heard in any movie ever. interstellar plays with many things that we arent able to comprehend and i think it does it very well. being drawn to someone we do not see or touch but still feel the same love is something so deep that i probably wouldve never thought of before watching this movie. the one thing i thought i wasnt going to buy into before watching it for the first time was the they id heard about when in the movie its referred to higher dimensional beings but i like the way it was done still kind of left up to interpretation as to who they are but i liked that being able to evolve passed the current dimensions we are able to tap into was such a cool thing to see ill never not be fascinated by thought of time being a physical object somewhere out there. wasnt fortunate enough to see it when it first came out in theaters for the first time. but i was grateful i got to see it in imax and wow. christopher nolan and his team have such a way of making you feel like youre there entering atmospheres going through this journey along with cooper and the rest of the crew through wormholes and being out in space so far away from everything we know. a movie in space never felt more real to me than this. because my dad promised me it blew my mind to see that murphs ghost was cooper all along conveying the information from the black hole that was needed so that the remaining humans on earth could survive. the revelation of the lazarus mission being a sham that dr. brand never intended for the people on earth to be saved completely changed the way i felt about the movie. i was loving everything i was watching but i felt like that was an extra push that cooper already needed to keep the promise that one day we would be back to see his daughter. unfortunately being gone for so long that he wasnt able to see her grow up like he wouldve wanted to but keeping the promise that he would come back and murph always believing he would was absolutely heartbreaking. i have not seen the theory of everything so i cant get much into academy awards. but its difficult for me to try and imagine a better performance by a leading actor than matthew mcconaughey in interstellar. every actor was great but matthew was phenomenal. to also speak on something i dont normally mention the music. the score is absolutely remarkable not for a second does it miss at some points i couldnt hear the characters speak as clearly because of the loudness of the music ive noticed that with other projects by christopher nolan but for me this i didnt care. this is up there with one of the best ever scored films. hans zimmer is a master at his craft. edmunds planet the fact that in the end brand was right love was right. after her mistake in millers planet that caused them to lose over two decades of time i could understand the hesitation towards trusting her judgment. but the fact that she was the one in the right in the end is so depressing but meaningful. love was the bridge for cooper to be able to communicate the information over to murph and for brands case it was also accurate because they wouldve been fine after all it they had gone to edmunds planet in the first place. love a topic i normally find corny but it wasnt overplayed or anything it worked to perfection and really leaves you thinking. i in my personal life was able to relate to feeling love for people at far away distances so it resonated just right and hit very hard. interstellar i may be a bit biased because it is my personal favorite movie of all time but i dont care thats something that will be very hard for any other movie to top for me it even made me look forward to want to have a daughter of my own to teach care and love for just as much someday. thats cinema thats what movies should be about make you feel something deep emotionally within you after watching thats what this movie did for me and i hope everyone out there has the same feeling for some movie they hold close to their heart.,32
2025.03.11,10,i have the highest expectation about this film because of the extremely positive ratings and reviews.... i never had that much expectation for a film before.... but still the film blew my mind. i never saw or even imagined anything like that......it isnt a movie it is a masterpiece in a century. i am so grateful that i was born in the right time where im able to watch this masterpiece. i dont need to write what happened in the movie summary or why im so touched and lost in the move.. if you havent just watch it. i have already watched it many times. i didnt press the 5second skip button on my keyboard for a single timei remember that clearly. so please if you still havent watched this movie...watch it. you will be grateful tooo. i dont know what im writing because im so lost in the depths of the movie.... i watch it on my pc. though i regret not watching on a large screen but stil im grateful. mentions i would highly suggest you know at least a little about 4d 5d and time dimensions as well as hypercube tesseract and of course time dilation. you should also know how gravity can work and communicate across all dimensions. i knew this before so it is very enjoyable to me...so if you didnt know about that then just watch 1 or 2 videos about that.,20
2019.10.05,10,i love how the music and the sound design give me immersion to the full history of interstellar i simply love it so much great experience to watch.,1
2020.11.04,10,masterpiece. my favorite and best movie of all time. story plot and characters are best!!!,3
2014.11.12,6,surprisingly weak effort by nolan who typically always nails his movies. the premises and outcomes all seem too silly and it is quite simply too long. matthew mcconaughey is miscast and often plays it quite melodramatic especially early. i read one professional critic who wrote that he was the perfect stonercowboy type to play the role. really?! hes not the actor id choose to be the smartest engineerpilot to save the human race with his brains. and spoiler matt damon is a throwaway. someone should have told him that was a sleeping pod not an eating pod. clearly nolan is fascinated with timetravel but this is a weak effort compared to inception and memento. hes a good enough director that its still watchable but it all feels so silly.,10
2025.05.20,10,interstellar is a movie about two things an attempt to save mankind and also a pledge to return to your family. its as gripping as it gets. nolan wants to show us that no matter how hard you try in order to help others its always the ones that you hold dearest that will feel most hurt if you dont get pull through. the movie is a gorgeous depiction of an unbelievable galaxy that feels understandable yet not present. its also a movie about desperation an attempt to save something that is doomed to fail and making that the absolute essence of work and dedication. nolan has accomplished something special in both this movie and inception 2010  his usage and adaptation of time. time is as key in the both movies but with different narratives. this movie speaks more about the choices we make while inception deals with a fundamental questioning concerning our perception of reality. its a stellar performance an incredible movie! emotional and inspirational!,10
2014.11.09,7,i give this movie an a for effort hence the 7 out of 10 but it ultimately fails. first of all this movie borrows so heavily from other movies of greater worth its almost again almost ludicrous. second if you go watch 2001 youll actually find interstellars visuals a disappointment compared to a movie made almost 40 years ago. sure they show a more accurate view of a worm hole and a black hole but its glimpsed or seen through a cockpit window or on a computer screen. this movie does not embrace the visual of space as it claims to. do we see what one of the planets that they are visiting looks like from space? uh no. gravity did so much better at its visuals than this movie does. as youve probably heard the main story line is basically not original and a bit melodramatic. i had no connection to it. i was more interested in the people who had gone ahead of them but we only meet one and hes unexpected and a jerk. but in reality how much? wasnt cooper matt m being just as selfish in some ways?? loved the music but so did the director with his heavy handed use of it.,14
2016.04.08,5,despite good acting and wonderful special effects im still wondering why the characters need to find another planet to live on when they already have the magnificent planet earth?  when young lausd los angeles unified school district students see this movie they actually think that if and when planet earth is destroyed that a space ship will be waiting to load all 9 billion earthlings fly them through a wormhole and land them all safely on a new habitable planet. some students even laugh at the thought of taking care of their home planet earth because it is disposable.  this is the sad message that this predictable fast bucks movie presents to the next generation that will be the future caretakers of our one and only planet earth.,4
2018.10.11,10,the best movie so far in my life.thank you jonathan nolan and christopher nolan for this diamond.im hoping to create something like that soon,3
2021.05.28,10,this movie will always be in my soul. ps. the soundtrack is one of the best.,3
2019.04.04,9,i am not going to go into spoilers but just know that in the horde of uninspired and generic space movies interstellar shines brightly. it is a masterpiece of subversions and it just keeps on building and building its plot and raising the stakes higher with each second and it keeps you at the edge of your seat constantly as you are wondering how it will all end. one of the most satisfying movies that i have ever watched and it will blow your mind.,3
2024.12.10,10,the production was amazing and very interesting credit to the actors and actresses for their brilliant acting and for the production for the world class setting. such an interesting movie to watch a fast phase movie that targets the heart and soul of the audience and hope that it will reach beyond their target audience as it is really worth it to watch and enjoy such great movie. no dull moments and no boredom just pure enjoyment you eill experience by watching it. either alone ir with companion you will surely not be bored so i encourage everyone to experience what i experienced and see it for yourself.,4
2023.01.27,10,best movie of all time. i generally dont write reviews but this was beyond my imagination level. each and every scene is presented in a perfect way with a great sense of acting screenplay and direction. this is one of the best movies i have ever watched the crazy journey to find a new home is filled with mind freezing adventures and crazy situations. i really appreciate the relationship value and love thats shown in the movie. makes me cry whenever i see it. its a complete package for everyone filled with space time  physics love and family. dont waste your time. go watch it now!,9
2015.11.19,10,the theoretical physics involved were astounding. dont know how else to describe it. the futuristic dust bowl. the dictation of education. the dimensional transitions. it couldnt be any more logical.  yes its all scifi but every scientific theory was considered scifi at some point in time. this movie nails the scenario it portrays. this will probably remain as my favorite matthew mcconaughey movie forever. i have to say it may beat inception on my scale of favorites if any of the theoretical science comes to fruition. inception is incredibly fictional however not impossible and was hands down my favorite scifi movie ever. interstellar is now in a shoving match with it between my top 2.,12
2015.01.12,6,interstellar had some very interesting topics for one that were ruining our planet. its probably the closest thing to reality in the entire movie but its worth taking at least that message. interstellar reminded me of the grandeur shots of 2001 a space odyssey music included. the power chords blew through the speakers in the cinema was quite deafening. but i can only say the cinematographically speaking the movie is excellent. the only thing i miss here is some overview shot of the solar or black hole system theyve entered yet they make it up by at least letting you see a limited view of the planets they visit. which brings me to the next topic because if they would have spent less time on useless discussion plot lines and just plane slow story development and more into the outline of the galaxy the movie would probably by far better.  yes the slow story is very very annoying and i frequently had the feeling move along already! the relativity of time was nicely put into view though i have question marks about some presentations of it. eg. if i was a scientist i would visit the planet closest to the black hole as last. since they lose years by the minute the consequences of something going wrong is far too high. the other two scientists could die humanity could have been extinct ... i also wander if the scientist on board of the endurance would have kept his sanity during the long waiting time. also they were pretty close to the remaining scientists and could have sent signals to keep contact. when they slingshot by the black hole gargantua cooper falls into the black hole and this is were i found the movie totally going off. even if he would survive until he reached the event horizon from that point his body would literally be ripped apart. when he reaches the library i a had feeling of utter annoyance of how the story was developing. i must admit it was clever of the director on how they pass back and forth through time and how cooper showed his daughter what to do but the nagging annoying feeling didnt leave me and even came back when cooper woke up on the space station that appears to be close to saturn and which didnt make sense to me. earth was seriously lacking resources so how were they able to create such a flourishing space station at that point in space and in less then 100 years coopers daughter is about to die so even if she reached a very old age the time span between him leaving and the building of the space station is less than 10 decades. an uplifting from other space movies must have been tars and case. not only have they got an original design but i was silently expecting one of them to crash or behave erratically like in 2001 a space odyssey or alien and that didnt happen. all in all interstellar is not a bad movie be it annoyingly slow at times.,23
2024.11.22,10,interstellar is without a doubt one of the most impressive scifi films ive seen in recent years. christopher nolans direction paired with hans zimmers haunting score creates a truly immersive experience. but what stands out the most is matthew mcconaugheys remarkable performance. his portrayal of cooper a father torn between saving humanity and being with his daughter is incredibly moving. mcconaughey brings such depth and emotion to the role making every moment on screen resonate. the films exploration of time love and sacrifice feels both epic and deeply personal cementing interstellar as a masterpiece in modern cinema.,6
2015.03.22,7,im never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies  after all similar to millions of other people i only watched a twodimensional series of images under persistence of vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. i wasnt actually there or wanted to be either and i have no intention of reading einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. i wouldnt even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a so what that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too. its a 21st century cgi cartoon update on when worlds collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001 with a nod to close encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries sorry galaxies as the earth or at least the american midwest is slowly dying. it involves going through a saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a cosmic pinball wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to us by them whoever that lot were. oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to interdimensional gobbledygook to ensure some peoples eyes dont glaze over. a few points playing love is all around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people director christopher nolan used grizzled michael caine yet again he must be a really big pal robbie the robot from forbidden planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky tars  co. on display as ai in here on that bloody icy planet cool customer matt damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didnt expect to be ever opened up again i ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers  i dont expect everyone or anyone for that matter to be up to laurence oliviers standard of diction but were not all kings of leon fans somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! the money shots for me were the emotional and fraught lander craft redocking with the endurance scenes however it was taken so slowly i thought for a while anne hathaway had fainted. the cartoonery is routinely spectacular at eyecutting edge. basically as with inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er wellgrounded but unwary viewer get over it and its entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt  i switched on switched off and enjoyed it. way too long though it seemed to last decades.,13
2014.11.17,3,the plot is pretty standard nothing new at all if youve read enough sf classics. the male cast is good the adult female cast is awful a small number of scenes are impressive the socalled music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard but all that doesnt matter because... you cant hear anything when people talk. hum sorry i was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. and so is mr nolan who possibly didnt bother checking his final product. the thing that passes for music is that loud. reading lips sometimes help but half the talking is through radio anyway so good luck with that. thats when i realise that nolan cant actually tell a story through pictures. in many scenes what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen and i would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening but i cant decipher it because you know idiots at the helm. in the same vein there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. and maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations but ill never know because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track i wanted to hear and nobody cleaned it up. during the projection i was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. thats a first. hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence. save your time and money for something made by caring professionals.,15
2019.08.17,10,by far one of the greatest films!i urge you to see for yourself,2
2022.07.14,10,everyone will have their own take on this film but for me the message is that a great dad will do anything to protect his family. whether it involves diving into the darkness without a safety net or traversing the boundaries of time and space its all in the job description. and as corny as that may sound its true. i absolutely love this film even with its quirks.,4
2021.01.30,10,this the most close definition of perfection. i can till this movie is a masterpiece by the meaning of the word.,2
2021.05.06,10,watch this movie with no expectations or even without watching the trailer. sound tract alone is noteworthy.,2
2020.09.10,10,mindblowing ! my go to movie it may have even pipped my all time favourite to the post which is one flew over the cuckoos nest. the musical score is stunning the cinematography is spellbinding and the who concept it beautiful. the more times you watch it the deeper you get pulled in just like gargantua. this movie is very special to me. i love it,6
2021.08.12,10,this movie was so but so good it was my favorite of all the time it opened my mind so bad im not being able to sleep its just so good i have no words i just hope that everyone feels the feeling im having rn cuz its amazing.,1
2015.10.26,6,its a pretty good movie. youll be immersed in the visuals the graphics some mystery and a review on quantum physics in space and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. however the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. the narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. theres a sequence toward the end that while engaging is some of the most over the top dramatic justforeffects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. it worked in inception but not in interstellar. overall it is a pretty good film but it falls short in so many categories. the visuals are worth the ride and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. if only they would have spent more time on the water planet that was the best part of the movie but then if they did every hour was worth 7 years on earth so the story had to go elsewhere. the other graphics were good too. but there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its current 8.7 rating. for example was matt damons space crazy dr. mann even necessary? the answer when you think about it is no. it had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. what a waste of top level talent.,17
2019.05.05,10,i really liked this film and the music in this film.,1
2015.02.13,6,i think that the film was an ordinary scifi movie not more. the emphasize on social aspects of human and magical role of love seems just a repeated slogan. the reasoning was completely naive and its was very clich. even the dram and tragedies of the film was childish. in term of story and content i didnt like it overall but there were some nice contradictions in the story esp in the beginning the sentimental scenes between matthew and his daughter and also there were some good surprise however very clich in scifi at the end of story.  i term of visual aspect this is a good film. i didnt like the story part but this part was good. there were some shots which was crazy.  if you like to see a good wellwritten film even scifi and the storyfantasy and creativity is important to you this movie isnt satisfactory i think.,9
2018.03.26,1,i found this pretentious crap. after some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of science fiction from the days of astounding and galaxy very few films have lived up to expectations. 2001 the best of the lot. the mix of sugared family relations and handonthe wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me sorry i did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish.,4
2019.10.05,10,by this point christopher nolan became synonymous with thought provoking films l...and adding to his well established filmography is this brilliant magnum opus... beautifully concieved by the minds of chris nolan his brother jonathan nolan and astrophysicist kip thorne the science portrayed in this film by this time proven to be plausible along with the father daughter relationship combines to form a visual spectacle unlike any other... highly recommend to watch it...,4
2020.11.11,10,its been over 6 years since i see this movie and i had to rewatch it again for the 4th time to transport myself to a truly amazing outer world experience. the nolan brothers wrote this masterpiece and christopher nolan directed  what amazing minds! this scifi movie had everything i want and more in a movie.... action love intelligence aclass acting and space exploration. i adore every part of this film and the ai robots that follow the characters about in the film add a wonderful touch. this movie blew my mind back then and it still does now.,6
2015.12.12,8,interstellar is one of those scifi that demands your attention throughout the film.if you are hoping for action like the dark knight or inception you would surely be disappointed. for me it is more like feeling the movie rather than just watching it.matthew mccaughey nailed it this time. the only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.the plot has so many holes that you cant help but notice.anne hathaways one dialogue ruin its ending.love is the one thing that transcends time and space.seriously? i mean if you want to take liberty in black holes quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.anyway overall its a fantastic movie after all its a nolan movie. so overall i have to say this is a must watch movie in fact one of the best movies of the decade.,12
2020.11.05,9,must see movie. one of nolans epic. story moves fast with emotion and stunning cinematography and sceenplay. most of all zimmers amazing score which will make u cry . it is one of best space exploration movie ranking atleast within top 3. 100 percent worth watching.,6
2022.06.20,9,i will start of this by saying the negatives which their are few of. the story can at times be a bit offputting or even confusing if your not giving full attention. especially the end which i personally liked alot but it is a bit odd what happened and i can see it not making alot of sense for people. the acting is mostly solid but theres a couple actors in here which arent the best mainly john lithgow which he does fine but not good a few of the side characters and child actors though ofc its not their fault. the shots can occasionally be odd in how some shots feel too far away to how i think it should be even though mostly the cinematography is solid. only the positives. the music in this film is not only brilliant on its own it is so well put into the film to fit however its supposed to be used much more elegant ways then most films. the music is probably my favorite movie soundtrack at the moment too. the cinematography is great at almost all times the shots on the sides of the ship i think are really cool alot of shots spin with them there was a shot that was intentionally blurry in here to fit the mood and the camera shakes when its appropriate and is usually still when not. as well i feel the more intense shots are done wonderfully following very well if needed. acting performance from matthew mcconaughey i think might be his best performance which says alot as well the performance from anne hathaway is really great here and some of her best work. and this is definitely jessica chastains best work ive seen. matt damon as usual does excellent. and michael caine also does pretty alright even though he feels pretty emotionless for alot of the movie but also kinda mysterious which can fit that character. john lithgow does fine good for him though and i like how he did just not too great. and i could name all the actors but really for the most part they are all good. the sets on this film and effects are top notch. ive heard a lot of the space scenes namely the one coming out of the wormhole took up to 100 hours to render each frame which definitely shows. the space shots are beautifully detailed and the sets on earth are great because they actually grew a cornfield. the story of this film is also great and is executed very well. its told like alot of nolan movies though memento dunkirk where mysteries are introduced throughout and explained later and the story is kinda told in reverse to traditional stories. but the story makes perfect sense up until the very end which i think does but is debatable. and feels really smart and scientific. using actual science to explain alot of this stuff and properly doing so. i love all the little details they added here too like every tick on millers planet was one day that kinda stuff is really cool doesnt make it much better but just interesting. which this movie has tons of! over all i feel its a 9.2 spoiler portion real quick for this end people dont like the end but it feels very right to me it makes sense in the plot and is explained fine but definitely seems a bit unlikely. but feels like a good ending everything is wrapped up nicely with a bow and not in a all good way but just a very nice ending. not all is made up for at the end either. hes still missed atleast 80 years on earth. while it failed. but my only problem with it is how did they colonize so fast? still a good ending and i also like where they imply goes with brands story but never shown.,34
2015.11.19,10,intersteller opens at an unspecified future date in americas farm belt. although the film is careful not to identify a year its probably around 2050. the world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. with nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. former nasa engineer and test pilot cooper owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family son tom daughter murph and fatherinlaw donald. drawn by almost supernatural means to a chainlink fence around a supersecret location cooper finds himself facetoface with what remains of his former employer an underground think tank dedicated to saving the human race. led by professor brand nasa has developed two plans. the first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. the second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. there are problems with plan a  namely overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship  but brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible. this is the movie that shows how the world will end due to human activity that caused and how the human tries to explore the galaxy to find a new home for humanity.,12
2015.02.01,6,tooo long tooo much like 2001 add a bit of event horizon dark star black hole armageddon space 1999 star trekking.... the one. with god  all that was missing was bruce willis and batman sorry alfred did appeared  enjoyed it trough far to many plagiarisms expected something better than space that was really dull gravity wasnt strong enough lost in space was more dynamic and scientifically more inaccurate hal2000 unit. robbie the robot was missing. needed a panama airplane somewhere kubrick did film the apollo moon landings where was room 237?,5
2022.07.08,10,after watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 i swore to god i will wait 5 years to watch it again so i get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again this without doubt is the best movie ever made.,1
2020.09.08,7,i had heard a lot about this film and how people had to watch it several times to fully grasp its complexity. i came to the film with tons of expectations but it was kind of a letdown. half baked characters especially the women. i am not qualified to question the science so not getting into that at all. what i can say is that the motivations of characters are extremely sketchy. emotions are not nolans forte. the scenes in which characters wax poetic about love are just bad.,7
2014.11.10,1,his 4th dud in a row a ridiculous plot for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn so no animals birds or fish even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on once again nolans characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space he becomes super intelligient because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind how he knows this we do not know given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making others have mentioned its look  well to me it looked shabby endless shots of aircraft wings no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank god i did not see this in imax would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise with hans zimmers worst and most bombastic score  added onto very loud sound effects with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover.,11
2022.02.15,8,entertaining. consistent. spacetravel at high stakes. its hardsf. plays with the rules of physics. good story great acting great music. the movie has its own atmosphere look and feel. a mustsee. anyway its now a classic of sf that brought a lot to this genre.,9
2020.10.31,9,i have already lost count of the times i have seen this movie and i am still fascinated by the beautiful soundtrack and the immensity of each frame,1
2024.12.24,10,i enjoyed thoughtprovoking science fiction that combines stunning visuals with a deep emotional narrative which this movie has shown. so i highly recommended interstellar. its an epic journey that leaves a lasting impact and sparks contemplation long after the movie ends. its a film that not only challenges our understanding of space time and relativity but also delves into human connection and perseverance. while the complex scientific concepts may be difficult for some viewers the emotional core of the story is universally relatable. its a cinematic experience that goes beyond traditional science fiction to explore the very nature of existence love and the future of mankind. with its stunning visuals haunting soundtrack.,7
2025.02.20,9,back in 2014 when only few selected cities in india had the privilege of imax screens in order to watch this film in a regular theatre i had to take a train journey to another state. and i did it twice. now after 10 years finally i got chance to watch this scifi epic as it is meant to be i.e. in an imax screen. the cinematic experience was unbelievable right from the beginning till the end credits. even avatar didnt had such an impact the way this nolans masterpiece has while viewing on the big screen. be it the cast storytelling cinematography or background score this scifi masterpiece has every ingredient that will leave you in awe when the credits roll. matthew mcconaughey as cooper is superb in his role of an exnasa pilot turned farmer in a dystopian future where the earth has become uninhabitable. coopers chemistry with his daughter murph is heartwarming that will leave you in tears on multiple occasions. this is something new from nolan who in his previous creations never really fixated his characters in such emotional things. music by zimmer is on another level and makes every scene a memorable one especially the cornfield chase the docking sequence and that timer on the millers plant. even writing about these gives me chills. not to mention the detailing of every scientific term to make it easy for audience to understand the concept is something that needs to be acknowledged. the amount of time nolan invested with the likes of nobel award winning scientist dr. kip thorne to make this movie so close to realism is something that has never been done before. planning to watch every time it is rereleased.,17
2018.09.08,10,im slowly losing count of how many times ive seen this movie. it was.....filled with pure emotion. it feels real because this could happen to earth one day considering were not making too much progress on protecting it and it might just turn on us one day. the acting is brilliant the dialogues are well thought through the visuals are beyond stunning and love goes across space and time. there wasnt a time where this movie didnt make me cry. even if i know what will happen i simply cant help it. its just one of those movies. it leaves me in a totally another dimension. even if you dont like scifi this movie cannot leave you emotionless. i can confidently say this is my favourite and ive watched a lot of movies. a masterpiece. thank you nolan thank you for this.,13
2025.05.08,10,this might be the greatest film of all time. bar none. no hyperbole. it takes one of the greatest fears of all humankind and brings the audience on an adventure of impossibility to the darkest corners of unexplored space where only quantum physicists have theorized and made it a movie. matthew mcconaughey is not known for his serious roles or at least not many. he will forever be remembered for this movie as a father searching for a home as a human looking for an answer and an earthling venturing through deep space. even if the story wasnt good enough this movie also included two incredible quantum space locations that have only been theorized but never visited. people are writing scientific papers based on the renderings and science of this movie! christopher nolan deserved an oscar for this movie as well as a noble prize for the physics he included in it.,9
2014.11.10,6,the beginning is awesome. matthew mcconaughey establishes himself in what could be one of his greatest roles. the themes of the movie are powerful covering our inability to forecastcompensate for a changing ecosystem coupled with our stubborn refusal to fund great endeavors like nasa. we do need to get off this planet and thats about where the movie ends for me. because theyre stealing from the inceptiontranscendence genre we start seeing plot devices for the sake of plot devices some of which make no sense. this wormhole for instance. or the tesseract. if humanity doesnt survive earth how does it retroactively create the impressive and nearly impossible things theyre going to save humanity with. its the kind of paradox that moviegoers pay good money for and leave good reviews but its ultimately garbage. what also got me was the reused tropes. 2 main characters and an extra on a mission. does this guy die or go crazy? die. check next one goes crazy. check. and that ending...the whole if you want it bad enough things will turn out good bit. nothing to do with saving yourself.,18
2025.04.05,10,interstellar is a breathtaking masterpiece that masterfully blends science fiction with deep human emotion. christopher nolan delivers a visually stunning and intellectually rich film that explores time love and survival. hans zimmers powerful score enhances every moment while matthew mcconaughey gives a careerdefining performance. the films portrayal of space travel is both realistic and aweinspiring. it challenges the mind and touches the heart leaving a lasting impression. interstellar isnt just a movieits an experience. a true 1010 in every possible way. in my opinion the greatest movie of all time.,8
2014.11.07,7,the epic feel of interstellar comes from its sheer length and scope of events but the actual impact of the plot line was lacking leaving me still unsure as to whether or not i even liked the movie. it feels like this is a film that the nolan brothers wanted to make without creative input from the evil movie executives who usually demand edits based on pacing or storycharacter complexity. in short its a directors cut through and through. some scenes or plot points were light or jumbled that i stopped trying to figure out what was going on and just let the movie take me for a ride in which i became more of a spectator than a moviegoer. the development of the movie itself felt a little like adhd netflix first its shyamalans signs then 2001 a space odyssey suddenly event horizon softened by the deadpan humor of dr. whoesque robots ending with luke skywalker hopping in a small spacecraft with his trusty droid off to find leia in the degoba system or whatever. though interstellar brings some new story mechanisms into play like einsteins relativity and what it would be like to exist outside of time these devices have been explored thoroughly outside of film  unlike the dream within a dream concept. at the end of the day the spectacular feel of interstellar is handicapped by its lack of solid delivery and plot disconnectivity. its worth the price of a normal movie ticket but dont be surprised if you leave the theater scratching your head.,9
2015.12.12,1,i resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism its artistic laziness  its technical sloppiness. i resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. by virtue of its sheer popularity on imdb its a testament to the colossal continuing dumbing down of movie audiences. where to start on specifics? the premise of a worldwide drought a major blooper mentioned on this site with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. okra grown as a major food crop or was that supposed to be a joke? cut  paste interviews from a ken burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. the tiresome cheapie homages to kubricks 2001. the pedantic astrophysics for dummies lectures.the soap opera characters. the one dimensional acting. the utter predictability of every single plot twist. id get more specific but then id be blacklisted for including spoilers.  you want to see imaginative mindblowing sciencefictionfantasy film making? let me make 2 suggestions stalker and solaris. both russian films directed by andrei tarkovsky. far lower budgets than hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. avoid the american version of solaris. its a travesty though not quite as awful as interstellar.  in summary the sheer numbing dullness  stupidity of interstellar  its concomitant popularity managed to knock me into the worst state of depression ive experienced from a movie in years.,20
2024.12.15,10,christopher nolans masterpiece is a cinematic triumph. hans zimmers hauntingly beautiful score elevates the film blending emotion and grandeur seamlessly. the story is a thoughtprovoking exploration of love sacrifice and humanitys survival rooted in grounded science and boundless imagination. matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway deliver powerful heartfelt performances complemented by stunning cinematography that captures both cosmic vastness and human intimacy. its a rare fusion of intellect and emotion that lingers long after the credits roll. a timeless epic. i bow down to everyone from the team.,7
2021.02.28,9,ill spare the usual details given that 4000 others have covered the story of interstellar. rather id like to say that once again i am truly baffled. baffled at how every film the nolan boys come together to write and direct using the genius of hans zimmer to score their work manages to evoke such emotion and captivate me to the very end. despite the bitterness i have after seeing what hans would do to the lion king in disneys liveaction remake i simply cannot ignore how unbelievably adept he is at his job. i decided to revisit this film after several years and found myself in tears by the end when cooper and murph finally reunite. and while the story itself surely had much to do with my reaction i cannot ignore the role hans compositions played from opening credits on to the very end. i felt that final moment in my chest as the two of them spent only a minute to acknowledge the journey both had taken. am going to go out on a limb here and say that without this specific composer the film would have been very very different. and nolan seems to know just this. the partnership seemingly continues to sharpen their skills with each production. its something i am in awe of as i watch the likes of interstellar inception the dark knight and dunkirk. an amazing scifi film with an original story to tell rare nowadays which you surely dont want to miss out on. this is one of those titles that i would put in the must watch pile as mandatory for everyone.,13
2015.11.23,10,a remarkable story of searching for footprints on a different surface...a story to remind us of the duty we have as earthlings and how things can quickly fall to pieces. a tale about the things parents will sacrifice in order for their children to fulfill their destinies and how that bond between them will always exist. one mans vision turns into another mans ability to pursue that goal at whatever cost to him. the harsh reality that time waits for no man and that no one can ever predict the future without suffering some sort of rejection for the present.,5
2025.02.09,10,a friend of mine suggested me that movie coz i told him that i love science. i was expecting something silly with aliens. well i couldnt be so wrong and im very glad for that. after they reached saturn i literally saw the movie with my mouth open. ive seen it so many times and i cant get enough of this masterpiece. i dont know where to start. acting? soundtracks? plot? everything just 10 out of 10. nolan made his miracle with that movie. thankfuly it doesnt have a sequel because it would ruin the essence of that movie. for someone who isnt familiar with physics and astronomy it may be difficult to understand but if you dig into the science of interstellar its not that difficult to understand it!,13
2021.04.03,10,this movie is the perfect example of what cinema can and should be. this is probably the most beautiful movie i have ever seen. the composition of the shots a great soundtrack characters that you will immediately connect to. this film is beautifully balanced and left me with a moved but very satisfied feeling. this is a movie you will not forget.,5
2022.07.12,10,first time i saw it was back in 2014 in imax and it was hands down the best film i have ever seen in theaters. i went into it thinking it would probably bore me and it ended up being one of my all time favorite movies. the acting score visual effects and writing are outstanding. i would highly recommend giving this film a watch if you havent already.,4
2015.02.17,6,its not really a good scifi you take away the wormhole and replace the setting with ww2 japan where a father has to go on a suicide mission and there you have it. melodramatic and not really reflective of humanity as a whole or our place in the universe. the film contemplates nothing significant and manages to tell nothing. basically a cheap tearjerker for usa audience cashing in on dwindling patriotism. protip if you want good scifi films try either sunshine or pandorum. they are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right. or heck even solaris if youre really that into melodrama.  im really disappointed in nolan after confused and often mindtwisting films like inception and the prestige nolan seems to be transforming into another side of michael bay where all those millions are more important than integrity.,8
2022.02.13,10,i think this is christopher nolans best film. btw i havent watched all but this is very close to me. i can recommend to every generation. you dont have to like scifi or something like that. i think everyone can love this masterpiece. good choice for a long night.,6
2014.12.09,6,ok i get it ! its a nolan movie so everyone huha about it. well actually no i do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the message board. while i went in expecting a nolan movie  i was sadly disappointed. i got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout and can even make me watch the movie a few times.  this movie is ok with its sci fi story. it does however drag many many times and goes very slow. a lot of drama and less science fiction. a lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. the family drama just doesnt ever stop. the movie is too long.  maybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90 it would have been great !,12
2014.12.13,2,how this travesty of a scifi movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either a i am way out of step with the great unwashed moviegoing masses or b the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great scifi flick. this movie was interminable i almost walked out 38 minutes into the run when mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a cornhuskin farmer.  which leads me to my first problem with interstellar would you hire a cornhuskin farmer and devoted dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions there is zero explanation  justification for matt to be selected for this mission. and strangely enough michael caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since matt blasts off for strange new worlds. he is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when matt blasted off 23 years before the directors did give mike a wheelchair for good measure. before i proceed there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists and the cgi  special fx were very good just like gravity another recent scifi disappointment although the robot was utterly ridiculous more like a walkin talking 21st century soda machine or a gen 12 robbie the robot.  of course cgi and special fx alone do not a classic scifi film make. i cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the spoiler clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film and it just didnt work.  i have now accepted grudgingly that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. read the cast list scratch your heads in disbelief along with me. and if you want a classic scifi movie? try 2001 blade runner and alien.,13
2020.11.01,10,this movie literally changed my life to before and after. sometimes i really want to reapaet the moment i was watching this film to feel the emotions again. what a greatness what a plot!! this is what cinematography should be about!! a must watch!!,5
2020.11.27,10,one of the best movies ever made. it is absolutely mindboggling and even though you dont understand a squat the first time watching it it still amazes you. ive watched this at least 10 times and it never gets old. i just love it.,4
2024.12.09,10,as a military chaplain i found interstellar 2014 thoughtprovoking and spiritually enriching. director christopher nolans masterpiece explores humanitys quest for survival love and transcendence. the films themes resonate deeply with my experiences ministering to filipino soldiers facing lifeanddeath situations.  the search for hope the movies narrative driven by coopers matthew mcconaughey journey through wormholes echoes the filipino value of pagasa hope. amidst uncertainty coopers love for murph jessica chastain inspires him to push beyond the boundaries of space and time. this selfless love mirrors the sacrifices our soldiers make for their families and country.  time space and divine providence the films exploration of time dilation and gravitational forces parallels the mysteries of divine providence. as cooper navigates the vast expanse he encounters moments of serendipity and synchronicity. these moments evoke the filipino concept of kapalaran destiny reminding us that our lives are intertwined with a higher power.  human resilience and sacrifice interstellar highlights humanitys capacity for resilience and sacrifice. the astronauts bravery and willingness to risk everything for the greater good resonate with the filipino militarys values of courage and selflessness. the film serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices our soldiers make to protect our nation.  a cosmic perspective on faith interstellar encourages viewers to contemplate the intersection of science faith and humanity. as a chaplain i see parallels between coopers journey and the spiritual quest for meaning. the film inspires reflection on our place within the universe and the transcendent forces that guide us. interstellar is a powerful exploration of human existence love and the mysteries that lie beyond.,16
2022.02.03,10,the best movie i have ever watched  the shots  the story is absolutely mind blowing  emotional  majestic  hats off to the team and actors  i loved the cast its perfectly perfect for this epic movie .,1
2024.12.08,10,christopher nolans interstellar 2014 isnt just a science fiction film its a sweeping epic exploring themes of love sacrifice and humanitys enduring quest for survival. set in a nearfuture earth ravaged by blight and dust storms the film follows a group of astronauts undertaking a perilous journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. while the complex scientific concepts might initially seem daunting nolan masterfully weaves them into a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. the films narrative strength lies in its compelling characters. matthew mcconaughey delivers a powerful performance as cooper a former nasa pilot turned farmer grappling with the responsibility of leaving his children behind to embark on a mission that may never return him. his unwavering love for his daughter murph played with remarkable depth by mackenzie foy young murph and jessica chastain adult murph forms the emotional core of the film. the bond between father and daughter transcends time and space serving as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of familial connections. anne hathaways portrayal of amelia brand a brilliant astrophysicist adds another layer of complexity to the narrative showcasing both scientific prowess and emotional vulnerability.,8
2022.07.11,10,wow. i have no words ro explain what i felt when i watched this movie for the 1st time. i can only say wow. it has a story that i cant telle here cause only the movie can. you feel happy then you feel sad and then angry then mad and it just blows your mind! totally recomend! 1010.,7
2014.11.08,7,having looked at many of the earlier reviews i was staggered at much of their orgasmic nature. this film is good and well worth a visit to the cinema to see it. the imagery is excellent as we have come to expect from christopher nolan. the acting is ok but not oscar winning  in fact some of matthew mcconaughey and his texan drawl does get a bit tiresome by the end. the story itself inspires much thought but not in the same way as inception  that is quite a good thing really as your brain doesnt have to work quite as hard to keep up. seriously it is an ok film and a good watch albeit a tad too long  but the last 20 minutes is weird a little rushed and could easily be dropped. dont let my comments in any way put you off seeing the movie but please dont expect 10 out of 10 unless you are very easily pleased.,7
2022.03.01,10,taking it from this angel of view and the pure science added value i liked the cast and the perspective of direction that showed the conflict between his choices before and after knowing the truth .... it was amazing to watch this movie.,2
2024.03.18,7,a good science fiction film but in my humble opinion it doesnt deserve this rain of 1010 that i see on imdb and an 8.7 overall. maybe with the big rating i had too high expectations. the plot is good the actors are good. the music is very good too i even had the impression that it carried the film to a certain point. the planets visited were a bit disappointing i wish there was more to it than that. in all the infinity and unknown of space there is no limit to the imagination and frankly there hasnt been much. movie was a little long at times and the end you kinda could see it coming. theories about gravity were often weird. the rebellious father who doesnt care about the teachers opinions when it comes to his son irritated me a little. i found him immature. i found that people didnt care a bit when other people of team died. ah hes dead dammit! oh well lets continue... it seems like we had more empathy for robots. the robots were still cool though. i found that there were a few easy jokes and a light atmosphere in difficult moments and it was a bit unrealistic. as much as the film was long the beginning was very fast almost too fast with the random father who overnight becomes a potential hero to save the planet. at the end it felt a bit like i was watching a weird outer limit scenario. it becomes a little cheesy sometimes a little tryhard without really providing anything credible. i see best movies ever everywhere i find it exaggerated. it was a good film which entertained me. a good 710 for me i recommend.,23
2014.11.18,2,you know those special movies that leave you with something more than you had before you watched them? they enrich you teach you show you. this isnt one of those.  interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in nolans mind falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script. the script isnt the only problem with all of its hammy hokum and lack of character. even the heralded special effects are so clich at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas.  here is what happened. nolan saw some discovery channel show or perhaps pbs about the cosmos. he said to himself i could make an adventure movie about that. unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop he couldnt. i watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion. as cynical as it sounds after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage i question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm.,13
2022.02.15,10,after entering the black hole and getting stuck in multidimensional space cooper realized that gravity passes through the dimensions and can use it to send information about the black hole but before that it was the force of love that made murphy return to her room and look at the wrist watch.,1
2021.05.22,10,i cant start to name all the things that i feel while watching this movie. the soundtrack is absolutelety moving. i felt a different person when the movie ended.,3
2022.06.24,10,an emotive exceptional and original film that makes us learn a lot about physics and it inspires us to become a potential astronaut though ! it was a pleasant film to watch that you have cling to it though ! even if its a long film everything is important interesting and full of actions ! i definitely appreciated seeing that film and i do recommend you to watch it !,4
2022.06.20,10,this movie hit me on so many levels. this is one of the only movies i have actually shed a tear to. the time difference part just makes you feel some sort of way.,3
2020.11.08,10,i am a huge scifi fan star wars being my favourite film ever until i saw interstellar! the first time i saw it i was blown away! i love the science involved in this movie excellent cast and original story. i have since watched this film a dozen times and it is every bit as good as the first time.,4
2014.11.10,7,this movie is not his masterpiece. i actually like nolans movies such as memento the prestige and the dark knight trilogy. but this movie is too long and dragging it seems like waste of film to make a movie this long. why input lots of useless dialogue or scenes? the only part i like is actually the part theyre not in space as the effect on space is not really good and gets a little boring overtime. if i want to watch a movie with space i prefer and suggest to watch cosmos a space timeodyssey 2014 it have more awesome visual stunning effects than this movie and also more clever approach for your brain because it teaches you real science.  maybe nolan is not ready to make a space movie. if you think this is the best space movie of all time i suggest you watch the alien 1979 and aliens 1986 star wars and star trek franchises and 2001 a space odyssey 1968. i prefer hal 9000 over tars for an ai.,9
2015.11.22,10,.. since this isnt really a film its a psychedelic experience a journey to parallel dimensions we slip through the wormhole of imagination into the place where we always were but forgot to be. love its a lot of love hope and whatever it takes to conquer despair and the looming end of humanity. wow tears and intensity all the way through to the other side. i am compelled to write more but what can i say its all in the film go see it. whatever you do watch this film with those you love. it will stay with me for a long time to come i believe. now off to dream world and who knows where that will take me is brand waiting for me?,7
2015.04.02,6,unlike say michael bay christopher nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. its an admirable trait and the results certainly speak for themselves. unfortunately with interstellar his grasp on that rung is often tenuous and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war. technically the film is brilliant. the fx and the cinematography are absolutely firstrate. its too bad theyre in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. the cast do what they can but theres just nothing here for them to gain purchase and as a result i experienced a total emotional detachment throughout.,7
2014.11.09,1,a good friend of mine the writer mark shulman once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded so that sadly we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow imperceptible boil. christopher nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that interstellar is a love story. i will take them at their word and assume that whatever else i picked up on was left there unwittingly for the rest of us to parse through.  considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a saturday night i feel like its my prerogative when i have paid good money to take a film apart if i am still hungry for substance at the end of it and i will get my nourishment from something or other if not from the movies plot itself. the first thing that strikes me when i think back to the experience of interstellar is that it leaves me with nothing emotionally  no takeaway. i did not care about any of its characters or believe they were real and i did not really worry about the fate of humanity any more than the film itself actually does beyond paying it casual lipservice.  i wasnt awed like i may have been by other wondrous space movies that interstellar measures itself against or steals from and i am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. i suspect most viewers wont either once the collective neophile contact high has passed. for starters i do not like the moral core of the story interstellar is a film about saving humanity but it is unclear who will pay for humanitys failures. the film offers a great debate over where to repopulate but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. there is no therapy no penance no sacrifice. in a way this represents a subconscious confession about our cultures moral failures when we run out of spaces to consume and out of fertile ground to slash an burn we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have... but enough psychobabble. a dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about interstellar. the worst thing about the film is that to quote my girlfriend its ok to for characters to talk in pseudoscientific gobbledygook when the show is star trek because in star trek they all have pointy ears. interstellar may be worth a glance certainly for the photography and exciting visuals but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial selfsufficiency amid the vast nothingness.  the result is an often farfetched and unintelligible outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewers disbelief and cringing to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so. in hindsight it makes perfect sense that nolans tightest film is memento a discognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together or to remember where he started. interstellar is not an intelligent picture but a pseudointelligent one. it seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots  a sort of space odyssey version of who wants to be a millionaire? its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. to whom? no one knows. this technique seems to be trending within the nolans filmography. for the rest the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale black hole wormhole same difference and is often plagued by ridiculous starstudded cameos that shatter the viewers concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup.  the film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite contrived exposition filled with emetic pseudo physics sure to give an immature modern audience raised on batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. worst of all it feels long and never ending. sadly good science fiction is hard to come by harder than a good ordinary film even and although this picture is somewhat entertaining it fades away from the heart and mind like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed as we head home from the cinema once more.,29
2015.12.10,8,great movie. the beginning is interesting as we learn that they are in some future year and there is lack of food etc. i liked that part of introducing the viewer to the future earth. the worst thing is that it may actually be accurate. the movie has beautiful pictures but the first half gets a little boring nothing really happens. however that changes in the second half as the team travels through space. things start happening and emotions start appearing as well as suspense. there are good dialogues between the crew and those talks between astronauts and their families are really touching. however in the last third of the movie it really gets astonishing. the part of matt damons planet is exciting and from there it goes all the way up. it reaches its climax when the rocket is drawn to the black hole and all the process gets explained. it is a mind twisting movie with a great final. also the soundtrack is really amazing which is easy to explain hans zimmer. matthew mcconaughey has a great performance and for me its one of the movies of the year.,14
2024.12.14,10,movies are meant to be watched on the big screen is a saying i disagree with. most of the time i prefer my home setup. my 4k tv usually provides better visuals and my headphones actually let me hear what the actors are saying instead of the dialogue being a bassy garble. the best part i dont have to deal with inconsiderate people talking during the movie or lighting up my peripheral vision with their phones. that said i do make the exception for imax. no home theater setup can replicate the sheer immersive experience of watching a film shot on imax cameras in the format it was designed for. interstellar is the best movie ever made for imax. i recently saw interstellar in imax for its 10th anniversary. it was my second time experiencing it in imax the first being its original release. back then i sat in the front row and didnt fully appreciate the movie or the format. this time i was blown away. my god! interstellar doesnt just play on the screen it engulfs you. the breathtaking visuals and bonerattling sound design make it an unparalleled cinematic experience. forget gimmicks like dboximaxs sound engineering alone makes you feel every vibration and shake of the spacecraft. the vastness of space the colossal scale of planets and the beauty of the black holeis breathtaking on the ginormous screen. the docking sequence paired with hans zimmers no time for caution is pure cinematic magic. the soaring organ the pounding bass and the visceral sense of motionits not just a scene its a fullbody experience. its one of the most unforgettable moments ive ever had as a movie fan. while imax undoubtedly enhances the experience its not the main reason the movie is so great. interstellar is a masterpiece on its own. its story is original emotional and inspiring. the acting is exceptional with heartfelt performances that ground the films bold scifi premise. the soundtrack cinematography and special effects are among the best ever crafted for the screen. and despite its nearly threehour runtime it keeps you riveted with a perfect balance of tense action tearjerking moments and thoughtprovoking themes. interstellar is a celebration of classic epics like lawrence of arabia and 2001 a space odyssey drawing inspiration from their awe inspiring visuals and epic score. like those films it will be remembered as a cinematic achievement. put simply interstellar is meant to be watched on the big screen.,28
2018.10.03,10,after seeing christopher nolans interstellar it immediately became one of my favorite movies of alltime. the movie had such an impact emotionally on the entire audience. just as nolan provided amazing twists and turns in previous films such as the prestige and inception he delivers at his best in interstellar. i first saw this movie on my 18th birthday i thought it was a great surprise and gift. the music for the motion picture created by hans zimmer was absolutely incredible. at parts in the movie my heart was pounding and it felt as if it was in some ways real life. i love the part spoiler when matt damons character dies in the spaceship explosion and cooper docks to the space station as it is spinning in space the music gave me goosebumps. this is a story that focuses on family. the main character cooper leaves his son and daughter behind on a space expedition to save the human race. he travels through a wormhole and explores different planets to determine if they are capable of sustaining human life. one of my favorite parts in the movie spoiler is when relativity comes into play. a huge wave hits their spaceship and they are stuck on this water planet for over an hour. but due to the gravitational pull on this planet he ends up spending 23 earth years on it. when he returns to the original ship he had received many messages from his son and daughter. spoiler over the space of a few hours his time he had witnessed his son graduate from high school get married have his own son watch that son pass away and more. in the end he returns and his daughter is now an old woman. he promised her that he would come back to her he fulfilled his promise. this is a very intense and inspiring scifi film. it is motivational and teaches us of the importance of family and love.,19
2022.02.14,8,one of the best movies u will be watching again and again would take you on interstellar travel making you learn many new things and think deep.it creats an ambience u become deeply engrossed in.,2
2021.02.26,9,i watched this incredible movie almost 1011 time. not just i loved this movie the reason for watching this film is the concept that sir christopher nolan presented in this movie. the way he plotted every scene is just heart touching and must gave the viewers goosbumps the concept of dimensions and blackhole time it just awesome. as a physics lover this is the perfect movie for them who love physics and also persue there career on physics must watch this movie.,4
2025.02.05,10,its an incredible science fiction film not only because of its scientific and visual realism but also because its a film that talks about a fathers love for his children. many people find this film confusing and also that the part about love transcending spacetime is somewhat cringeworthy but it doesnt bother me at all. its a film that manages to convey a variety of emotions anger happiness sadness tension etc. the premise shows a future in which the earth is being destroyed by dust clouds that is by nature itself and they have to find a way to take humanity to another planet. the basic premise is well developed and the film manages to focus well on it. the relationship between the characters is very good. practically all the actors have chemistry with each other. many people find the scientific part boring but even without understanding it people can enjoy the film. other people find it cringeworthy that the film focuses on love which is the main premise of the film and all of this is well developed. the films script is perfect. initially the part about the phantom and them is confusing but in the end which is even more confusing it is explained. all of this can be open to theories and the ending of the film is also openended. again many people think this ending is anticlimactic and i disagree. its incredible. the visuals are simply beautiful. nolans realism is incredible the practical effects are perfect the performances manage to convey the characters feelings to us. the soundtrack by hans zimmer is spectacular. theres no way to complain about the audiovisual part of the film. its probably my favorite film of all time and one of the best films ever made.,19
2014.11.19,6,i initially saw the trailer for interstellar a few months ago and immediately decided that as the trailer painted it as a dull rather uninspiring scifi epic that i was not going to part with my cash or time by going to see it. over the last few weeks as the promotional machine has turned its wheels and following many positive reviews both in the media and by trusted friends of mine i took the day off work purely to go and see interstellar. i have to say partly because so many reviews and friends had said youve really go to see it in the cinema. so i didnt want to miss out. i started the film full of anticipation that i was truly going to see a masterpiece of cinema with a great cast engaging dialogue a thought provoking plot and stunning visuals and well it had stunning visuals apart from the external spacecraft shots looking like something from star fleet and not much else. to be fair there was a lot of dialogue. and several of the lines delivered by the robots approached humour. had it have been around an hour shorter i could possibly have brought myself towards saying it was enjoyable but in the main i really had to try hard to enjoy this film. its a strange one as it wasnt bad enough to be terrible but was nowhere near good enough to be enjoyable. at one point i was truly fighting the urge to get up and walk out but didnt as i assumed we were near the end we werent there was still an hour and a half to go i love christopher nolans films but this smacks of a director being given far too much praise and far too large a budget to play with. maybe i should have taken more notice of the trailer.,11
2024.12.08,10,interstellar is a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll not just because of its grand visuals or the complex scientific ideas it presents but because of its emotional depth and philosophical musings. watching it feels like taking a journeynot only into space but into the heart of human existence itself. christopher nolans ambitious vision transcends the typical boundaries of a science fiction movie leaving you with a sense of awe and a heavy introspection about what it means to be human the nature of time and how love can be an intangible yet powerful force. the first thing that struck me about interstellar was its scale. from the hauntingly beautiful shots of space to the sweeping landscapes of earths dying environment the film constantly challenges you to consider the vastness of the universe in relation to the fragility of our existence. as a viewer youre made acutely aware of how small we are in the grand scheme of things yet at the same time the story amplifies the power of human resilience and hope. the visual effects are breathtaking and for a moment its easy to get lost in the spectacle. but beneath all that the film quietly asks what is it that makes us fight so hard for survival even when all seems lost? i found interstellar to be an incredibly emotional experience. at its heart its not just about saving the planet but about saving what we love and what we hold dear. coopers relationship with his daughter murph is the emotional spine of the film and its a story of love that stretches across dimensions of time and space. the way nolan blends the cold impersonal theories of space with the very human emotions of family is striking. the theme of love transcending timeshown through coopers connection with murphfeels both hopeful and haunting. as someone whos personally experienced the loss of time with loved ones the idea that love might be the one force that can bridge the insurmountable gaps between us struck a deep chord. the films emotional weight rests on this idea and it gave me a sense of bittersweet wonder. while the film explores some complex scientific ideas i appreciated that nolan doesnt treat the audience like they have to be physics experts to appreciate it. yes the theories around black holes time dilation and relativity are intricate but they are not just a backdrop for the narrativethey also serve to deepen the emotional stakes. as cooper and his team journey through space the passage of time on earth and their inability to communicate with loved ones back home became one of the most poignant aspects of the film. it made me reflect on how fragile human connections can be especially in the face of vast uncontrollable forces. watching cooper the astronaut struggle with his desire to save humanity and his need to be with his children was painful and relatable. theres also something deeply philosophical about interstellar. at its core its a film about human ambition survival and our innate desire to understand the universe. it poses profound questions how far are we willing to go to ensure our species survival? how do we reconcile the future of humanity with our individual lives and relationships? and ultimately what makes us human in the first place? these are questions that dont have easy answers and thats what i appreciate most about the filmit doesnt offer up a simple comfortable resolution. instead it challenges you to think to feel and to wrestle with the existential dilemmas that we may one day face. one aspect of interstellar that i found both frustrating and fascinating was its pacing. while i was completely absorbed during the first half of the film the latter part of the movie especially the resolution can feel overly abstract and even slightly indulgent at times. some might argue that it loses its way leaning into metaphysical and philosophical concepts at the expense of narrative clarity. yet i couldnt help but admire nolans willingness to take risks with the storytelling. the film doesnt adhere to traditional expectationsit pushes boundaries and dares to explore uncharted emotional and intellectual territories even if it means sacrificing conventional storytelling for more challenging ideas. in the end interstellar is a film that defies easy categorization. its not simply a space epic or a disaster film its a meditation on time love sacrifice and the human condition. its a movie that made me look at the stars with both wonder and humility. its emotional complexity and thoughtprovoking ideas ensure that it stays with you prompting endless questions long after youve left the theater. and while i may not fully understand every concept it introduces thats part of the beauty of interstellarit leaves you thinking wondering and most importantly feeling.,37
2014.11.27,6,this movie really disappointed me. i liked christopher nolans films and made sure i read very little about this before i went to see it. it is ultimately about a man who loves his children. you can tell he loves his children because he never stops going on about them. he runs the full gamut of emotions showing his love for his kids like a deranged single mother on facebook constantly posting like if you love your children anyway he goes on a space mission and leaves his beloved children to save the world. whilst in space he discovers a fat matt damon who has apparently run out of provisions judging by the size of him i found that hard to believe. the film looked and sounded great but i couldnt get over the man constantly moaning and thought the ending was a bit obvious and ripped off 2001 and contact. the best bit was when fat matt damon died.,8
2015.03.19,1,as you can probably ascertain from my title sentence i am not a fan of mr nolan. however i dont have any bias prior to watching his films in fact quite the opposite i want to like his films as i really like his ideas and concepts which is why its such a shame he never delivers. i also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal certainly if you look at money they make but so far they have all left me cold. interstellar tdk and inception all have similar flaws on the positive side they are all really cinematic stylish and well filmed. they all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects. on the negative side the plots are terrible and make no sense. the dialog is flat and unrealistic there is no charisma or charm in the films they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. the characters tend to be robotic and cold not warm or humorous. the problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen but ultimately nothing does so it becomes a major let down. on to interstellar specifically warning spoilers a plenty the first hour of the film was very boring and very silly. the earth is running out of food so people still plant huge fields of crops which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. they have completely automated the process of farming crops yet they dont need scientists or engineers they need farmers which makes no sense. if the earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. scientists and engineers would be the most valued members of society. if the crops were so valuable they wouldnt be exposed to the elements and the dust. they would be covered and protected. everyone is so worried about the food shortages they dont take any notice of it. instead they drive around in huge petrol driven suvs from 2014 wheres the google cars or electric cars?. heres an idea. you now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships so apply that to the population of earth and reduce the need for food. anyway lets move on. they go into space arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. do they survey the area first check out the planet and landing area first in detail nope they just land. now i know there is time pressure but why havent nasa sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information. anyway this drags on a bit they visit another place which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film only after about 2 and a half hours. cooper flies into a black hole where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly but survives in some kind of advanced framework where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. after this there is a very silly ending. even though he is outside of time as it were and he can send messages to any point he cant for some reason stay in the same time as his daughter and how stupid was the 1970s minecraft designed robot. in the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great but the plot soul and charm of the film was completely missing unfortunately like all nolan movies.,29
2023.05.02,10,best sciencefiction movie ever. love christopher nolan and the masterpiece he delivers! visual effects and physical accuracy of things is amazing. this is likely one of my top 5 favorited movies of all time i want to erase it from my memory just to see it again. kip thorne the man behind all of the math and science was an executive producer on this film. listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes black holes and spacetime operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling. it is a movie worth watching and deserves more rating. you should watch it promise you wont regret it!.,8
2021.06.05,10,a complete masterpiece. the best movie ive ever seen in my life. christopher nolan has done it again.,3
2023.07.23,10,their were some flaws with the antagonists and the pacing but other than that....... oh my words! wow! i cant even describe how amazing this movie is because there are millions of things i can say. there were a whole lot more positive things than negative things in this movie. it was confusing at first but at the end it all made sense. imagine you were the main character of this movie though. this wasnt even a movie this was a whole experience. my favorite things about this movie were the music the cinematography and the ending. i loved every character in this movie and the acting was phenomenal as well. this is definitely a mustwatch.,11
2022.12.15,9,interstellar is a beautifully crafted movie that explores the limits of human understanding and the boundless potential of the human spirit. the story follows a group of astronauts as they embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. the movie is masterfully directed by christopher nolan and features a talented cast of actors including matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway. the score composed by hans zimmer perfectly complements the films epic and emotional story. the movies visual effects are breathtaking and the production design is topnotch. the movies use of special effects particularly in its depiction of the vastness of space is truly aweinspiring. overall interstellar is a mustsee movie for fans of science fiction and anyone who appreciates a welltold thoughtprovoking story. its a movie that will leave you feeling inspired and moved and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.,8
2024.12.14,10,when interstellar released in theaters in december 2014 i was not familiar with christopher nolan and i barely remember seeing advertisements for the film. as a result i did not go see it in theaters. my first time seeing it was at home shortly after its digital release where i was surprised at the stunning visuals and storyline. now a decade later i had the chance to redeem myself and see it on the big screen with the imax rerelease. while i have seen this movie 4 or 5 times before it did not feel that way watching it in imax for the first time. the cinematography for the scenes in space is breathtaking and the special effects still hold up 10 years later! even if youve seen this movie before seeing it in imax is well worth it!,7
2023.04.30,10,ive seen this movie at least ten times i try to watch it at least once a year. i had some friends over last night to watch it all of whom had never seen it. for nearly three hours six people sat in complete silence watching this story about family love and exploration. no one said a word. when it was over i looked over at my friends hoping they had liked it half as much as i do. i think that was the best movie i have ever seen was the general consensus. i dont want to spoil anything so ill just say this if you havent seen this yet and you consider yourself someone who likes movies you owe it to yourself to watch it. there is simply no better film in existence.,8
2014.11.13,6,the word id use to define this story is contorted..nolans intelligence is out of discussion but the problem here is the difficulty of finding a key. all of this effort all these questions all of this movie and for what? there is no answer there. nolans mind has conceived memento the prestige inception and now interstellar always exploring relevant existential questions but theres always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of proportions. the movies are about love theyre spiritually generic and require a lot of production.. but the overall idea is that the viewer doesnt know where the story is going.. again the previous question what for..?!,8
2020.12.30,9,you will be on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. masterpiece! the only thing i regret is that i did not see it in the movie theaters,3
2014.12.17,7,great music. an extremely talented cast. amazing special effects. captivating issues to contemplate. so why do i think i will not ponder this film long after i have viewed it? the story is convoluted though interesting. all the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale that tells us what? well not really much. but its a fun trip getting there. i liked many of the characters. and i was invested in their problems and tragedies. but the final explanation of the films phenomena has a sixth sense feeling to it.  i say see this film for its good points but dont expect the groundbreaking impact of kubricks 2001 or the atmospherics of blade runner or the thrilling ride of close encounters of the third kind.,13
2014.11.18,1,this is without exception one of the dumbest films i have ever sat through. or perhaps its a masterpiece and im too dumb to understand it? anyway ..... here are some of the things the list is not exhaustive that i could not get my head around. there is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. and the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says oh well. dems the breaks and does nothing. seriously? apart from that one dude in the super secret nasa compound? okay then. a super intelligent super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. they see that the planet is in peril. that more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. so they offer a solution. not by curing the blight mind. no that would be far too easy. they construct a wormhole they being five dimensional creatures n all close to saturn cos kubrick had already used jupiter in 2001. the film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight cornmash beer anybody but its only a matter of time before that too succumbs. so its a matter of great urgency that the astroheroes get to the ol wormhole as quickly as possible.  so the far side of the moon would be a handy place to put it.  no no noooo. they place the wormhole beside saturn. so distant from earth that it takes two years just to fly there.  and all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at pharming college. anybody for cornflakes?  now nasa have already explored the wormhole. they know that it opens into another galaxy beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on earth. while back on ol planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. so this was the plan? by the super intelligent aliens? is someone taking the pss? there were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... not right beside a black hole? super intelligent? doh!  and so finally after a number of silly subplots our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole my god! its full of stars?. and experiences time as a physical construct. but is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? hell no. he is shown his daughters bedroom on the day that he left on his weekend getaway. we see him getting really upset that his daughter isnt picking up on his stay ...... stay! gravity assisted message even though he should remember that she shouted stay .... stay! to him on that day and he left anyway. sheesh!  and zimmers soundtrack? i hadnt heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email without him ever seeing the movie. explains a lot really. presumably the email went something like if you produce anything orchestral like kubrick youre off the project. so the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven in the cinema where i watched it piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. bear in mind that kubrick chose the pieces by strauss etc. to assist him in editing the movieand then realised that they actually fit perfectly and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned. not nolan. nosirreebob! email it in hans. who listens to the music anyway? deeply deeply disappointing. and i loved inception!,62
2023.07.27,10,i can only but praise this movie for its great balance between action and drama. nolan known for his amazing story telling really knocks it out of the park here. not only is the story very interesting filled with curiosity and suspense the images are absolutely stunning. the computergenerated images of the fictional black hole are by far the best i have seen and the fact that these are supported by science makes it even more impressive. the music by hans zimmer perfectly captures the setting of the movie and is also one of the best soundtrack i have experienced in a movie. the strong cast lives up to its reputation with lead actor matthew mcconaughey embodying cooper.,6
2024.11.10,9,interstellar was amazing. one of the best movies i have ever seen. the story visuals and music were all great. it is just a powerful experience through space and time. the film blends science fiction with deep human emotions exploring love sacrifice and survival. the visuals especially the black hole are stunning and realistic. the performances are top notch with an unforgettable portrayal of a father torn between saving humanity and his family. the emotional depth of the story makes it even more powerful. it stays with you long after watching. i would give it a 9 out of 10. truly unforgettable.,11
2022.06.28,10,this movie is simply amazing. the acting the writing the emotion that this film holds is simply outstanding. i cry almost every time i see it. however the greatest part of this movie is the entire storyline. its a complex masterful and very imaginable plot that definitely holds your attention the whole time. please just watch this movie it is spectacular.,6
2022.07.17,10,curse food deficiencies and absence of oxygen. as indicated by the book the science of interstellar by kip thorne the film envisions a future where a blend of disasters lessens the number of inhabitants in north america ten times or more with comparable ramifications until the end of the world. every dream hope and theory make this films perfectly. the main things astronomical science and intimate human connection playing another level.,4
2023.02.18,9,interstellar is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful scifi film directed by christopher nolan. set in a future where the earth is dying the film follows a team of explorers who embark on a dangerous mission to find a new home for humanity. led by matthew mcconaugheys character the team travels through a wormhole in space facing numerous obstacles and breathtaking vistas that will leave you in awe. the films impressive special effects combined with hans zimmers masterful score create an immersive and captivating experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. at its core interstellar is a story about the power of love and human resilience in the face of impossible odds. the themes of time space and relativity are explored in a thoughtprovoking manner adding layers of depth and complexity to the already compelling plot. the films finale will leave you both inspired and moved as it touches on the importance of love family and our place in the universe. interstellar is a masterpiece that sets the standard for modern science fiction films.,8
2022.05.05,10,this movie is insane the graphics were amazing and the way they were able to make the space and galaxy look so real and the acting was 1010 and i would die to watch this movie again for the first time it changed my mind on things and it literally is the most perfect movie eve u dont think any movie could do better it just shows how the galaxy could be and that we should look more and this movie deserves all the oscors.,1
2014.11.27,6,sorry but who hyped this movie? did they pay you for the reviews? physically so much sh. how the fk can a space ship need more time to get to a position than a guy by feet? or is able to escape from a planet with more gravity than the earth but on earth they need a rocket?? even better was the situation of the waves which are big as a mountain but no one saw them until they where next to them are you kidding me?  enough with the physic what about the dialogs? the only funny stuff was the robot! if it wasnt hyped i would not write but i try to rate it rationally so 6,9
2025.05.20,10,interstellar is a really great movie with a smart and interesting story. it talks about space and big ideas but also about family love and hope. the story is easy to follow and keeps you curious the whole time with exciting moments and surprises. hans zimmers music is amazing and makes the movie feel even more exciting and emotional. the space scenes look beautiful and very real. the movie also uses real science to make it believable which makes it even cooler. interstellar is a mustwatch for anyone who likes exciting thoughtful and powerful movies that make you think and feel a lot. 1010 2nd favorite after the dark knight.,8
2014.11.08,6,setting aside the science behind the film and yes you really do need to have an advanced degree to understand it the thing that most takes away from this film is lack of a coherent story. too many loose ends and questions arise that cant simply be overtaken by the wow factor of the visuals. example matthew mcconaughey plays a former nasa engineerpilot who iswas according to michael caines character his former boss the best nasa had ever produced. and yet mcconaugheys character didnt know nor had been tapped for a secret project to launch people into a nearby black holecorridor to another galaxya program that had been going on for years while earth was slowly turning into a dust ball. wouldnt you think nasa would have located their best  brightest to launch him into the black hole? mcconaugheys character a widower doesnt have to do much agonizing to leave his two young children behind on a multiyear mission to get to the black hole through it and come back with news from the other side on where humankind can pick up and move to. eventually his daughter goes to work for nasa shes just there one day all grown up no back story and the daughter and her brother both become estranged. again no back story to speak of we just have to accept it the film is already too bloody long so there was no time to develop the characters. ultimately it is a movie about a father and a daughter and everything else is backdrop to propel that story. the problem is most of that sweet story is lost in loud special effects and rabbit trails. im glad i watched itonce. thats all ill watch it.,12
2014.11.08,1,it is incomprehensible to me that i watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on imdb seemed to. perhaps i was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole wormhole or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. all i know is that my hardearned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that i am truly regretful. like a few other commenters i had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. a ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases very little of this movie makes any sense at all. it amazes me that nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel. i should note that on several occasions i actually couldnt help but laugh out loud at the absurdity and that fact was truly telling for me. mr. nolan et al  you owe me two hours and fortynine minutes of my life back!,9
2021.05.27,10,a wonderful and very impressive science fiction movie i suggest you watch this movie and do not miss it.,1
2022.06.04,10,some movies are close to heart. this is one of them... its more than just a movie... i cried when i watched this movie... thanks so much for the director for directing such kind of movie.,5
2015.11.22,9,this is the best movie which blends the time travel and lot of information into a single script it takes me 3 times to get the story completely. the director have moved the story in a nice way which makes the people to think before they can watch the movie. this also made me to think of is there really a 5th dimension??. sure if you watch it deeply you can never get out of the concept unless you are fully aware of the story before you see. the screenplay was really outstanding and provided the best visual. sound  nothing to mention it was really awesome. and about the cast they were excellent and blend nicely into the character. lets hope there is a sequel to this movie which suggest how she solved the equation with her fathers help and it may help me to get the story to full end. this is really challenging story and i will be waiting for its sequel.,9
2015.11.22,10,good day everyone! hopefully your having an interstellar day sorry for the pun! so on with the review!  christopher nolan takes a huge step against the megahits of 2014s summer releases with a scifi epic of very brave proportion. enter interstellar.  a team of scientists pitted against a dying and hostile earth with dust storms reminiscent of the dust bowl of the 1930s discern the source of strange happenings within our galaxy that may lead to our salvation. with the advent of suffocation and an eerie force later alluding to a gravitational anomaly nasa begins operates in secret and dispatches the worlds bravest into the stars. leading the ensemble cast matthew mcconaughey stars as cooper an expilotturnedfarmer who receives a strange decoded message from his daughter murph played by jessica chastain and mackenzie foy that eventually leads them to the start of this epic journey to save humanity.  will these scientist achieve the impossible by exploring an unnatural occurrence of a wormhole near saturn and find the habitants of earth a new home? or will all be lost? packed with visual feasts a fantastic musical score and an emotional undertone that will shake even the most hardest war veteran to tears cooper and team set out to perform the impossible before nature itself threatens to stop them.,11
2025.04.29,8,i had to rewatch it cause its leaving netflix. and this is such an epic that it deserves a rewatch at your leisure on netflix. at least thats how i view netflix. it felt kind of like a chore though cause its so long and i only had a few days to decide on and i thought id maybe split it but once i started it i just got into it immediately so that was last night. i didnt remember much from it apart from the concept and some key moments but it was such an experience i couldnt put it down so i just sat through almost three hours of this and loved it. its so epic and then so simple but oh so creative but also such an amazing story stripped down to the basics but so humane emotional and thoughtprovoking scary but uplifting its just everything. i have no idea whether the science makes sense in this and i am unclear on some of the logic and sequence of events and if you ask me in a month ill have no idea how any of this works but it is majestic and it doesnt rely of special effects although it does have some amazing visuals but it makes the story so personal and heartbreaking that its just the full package. the perfect dystopian scifi movie with a good ending and some cool aha moments. also that moon landing redaction and spin was crazy i gotta say.,9
2018.07.13,9,fascinating story with beautiful scenes and music that really draws me in. i start with why it still does not get 10 points. the early sequence when cooper hacks into the drone and controls it seems a bit awkward to me if it was meant to characterize him. and although it is a clever idea to watch cooper observe the past and not simply time travelling i was a bit disappointed because the story is not consequent in the aspect of manipulating the past. on the other hand i was intrigued by the aspect of ageing as a consequence of gravitation and acceleration and how this is incorporated in the script. what i further like about this movie is the visualization of higher dimensions. and the fact that the are no aliens only human beings. the size and desolation of the universe that we see emphasizes the message that humanity itself is responsible for our planet.,8
2014.11.13,7,interstallar 2014 this is a christopher nolan movie. so when it does what he does bestshake you out of your seat with cinematic brillianceits terrific. i mean terrific. there are effects like the black hole or the various spacecraft maneuvers and even a few wild dashes through cornfields that work so well you dont need to think about why they are happening. you are immersed and impressed and wowed. but nolan is more clever than deep it seems. a movie like memento takes the slimmest of terrific ideas a reordering of time in the brain and make it amazing to watch. movies like his batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. but in all of these there is no sense of what you would call meaning. they are entertainments.  interstellar is purely horrible scienceits the butt of endless jokes on the web. but behind all the liberties and mistakes there the movie is trying to say something deep about being human in an inhuman universe. about the special qualities humans have to be innovative to procreate and most of all to love. this is a bowing down to the power of love. love conquers all that kind of thing. maybe its the brother jonathan nolan who is responsible here as the cowriter. the grandiose ideas the two of them present in batman rises are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. in context theyre part of the whole great success of the movie. but interstallar takes itself seriously. way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science not even a hint of it. as a fantasy it could have gone so much farther as a piece of art based on reality well go see gravity for an alternative that makes a better imperfect attempt to follow the rules of nature. there is of course the plot here saving the world saving the species saving your family. you have to just go with the flow here as well since its all a bit romanticized in a spielbergcameron kind of plasticky gloss. it frankly made me sickand yet it was so well filmed i liked it. thats the kickernolan is terrific with the camera and with the vision of making things vivid and big. see this movie for all of those best things. i saw it on a celluloid nondigital imax screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format the effects were memorable. the movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full academy ratio 70mm which is taller and has far more detail. the normal theater presentations approximate the effects but in a more normal scale and resolution.  obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. im not sure who they are but its reasonable to be blown away. nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaintsas if everyone is wrong and we just dont get it. fine. if you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie see httppopwatch.ew.com20141108interstellarplotholes or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google. but what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms.,37
2025.06.06,10,a second viewing a firstclass masterpiece to say interstellar is an emotional mindblowing rollercoaster feels like an understatement. ive just rewatched it nearly a decade after first seeing it back in 2015 or 2016 and im honestly stunned. not just by the scope or the visuals or the sound but by how well it holds itself together. im struggling to quantify just how good it is. this isnt just one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. it might well be one of the greatest films full stop in any genre. theres a weight to it. a gravity. not just the black holes and time distortion but the emotional pull the love of family the will to survive the longing for something more something better. it manages to be intimate and cosmic at the same time and thats no small feat. i found myself looking for reasons to knock a point or two off. maybe its too ambitious? maybe it leans a bit into sentimentality? but i couldnt find anything that really stuck. nolan weaves so many complex ideas together from relativity to hope from loneliness to legacy and it never feels like its trying too hard. it just works. it channels the spirit of clarkes 2001 and 2010 but adds a modern weight the ache of climate collapse the fear of failure the hope in exploration. the mission to survive isnt just practical. its deeply human. somehow interstellar balances the impossible theoretical physics raw emotion and breathtaking visuals and still keeps its story tight and engrossing. it is quite simply astonishing.,21
2014.11.08,6,im probably not the target audience for the freres nolan as i tend to notice things instead of being seduced. take the opening. were in east jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. an ordinary family a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. inside an equally ordinary kitchen then in the bedroom of the daughter of the house murph we find floortoceiling bookshelves? fully stocked. youre putting me on right chris. more? seems the father of murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. no real problem there but he and murph stumble on some coordinates and follow them to a topsecret nasa base where the head honcho is professor michael caine. they show the intruder the latest spaceship explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life and then invite him to lead the mission. this is a guy who hasnt flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. there is no training programme no vetting the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest topoftherange lamborghini. if you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. unlike say gravity which was virtually one hundred per cent in space intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. clearly the nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way pavlovs dog responded to a bell.,16
2014.11.06,5,even the title interstellar evokes greatness and the movie express this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture quality go to imax 70mm and definitely communicated by soundtrack. nolan knows that when you have hans zimmer on board you have an insurance with his music you can transform even your dog daily service in an epic movie. moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give a great pace to the story. 910 on everything up to now. but when it comes down to the plot we barely reach 610. i will never understand why those hollywood megaproductions that can do everything and have all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across the plot. while looking at the movie it is like realizing that some good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with great details like the dust the robots the hibernation beds and then somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. here some first of allthe whole thing does not add up the first time cooper leave earth who sent him the nasa coordinate?? non sense. second at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too much emphasis has been placed on the message stay. i understand it adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the ending. from there on you are only curious on how he will communicate back which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie. third i loved the transition between the departure from home with the truck and the rocket launch but wait a moment. three stages saturn v rocket to reach the earth orbit ..ok they were using spares from apollo mission..ok.. and in all the rest of the movie these guys land and launch from 3 different earthlike planets by using simply the small spacecraft??? cmon.  fourth ok you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to your daughter? of course binary coded coordinates of nasa installation!! not your name not her name but coordinates of the nasa launch site so that the youngeryourself can leave!if only all that you want is for him to stay which is what you will send immediately after. ok maybe he do not know that he him self will start the whole thing just by following those coordinates.. wtf!!why?? guys i can understand you need to send cooper to nasa but couldnt you find something else? fifth. this is minor but really annoys me that in 2014 in the interstellar production you screenwriters team need again to make someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create again the runforitbuticant scene on a planet in which every minute is a year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some unknown data!? cmon!  you guys have the best technicians and movie artisans can afford almost everything you like then again why you have to slide on the banana peel? i will never understand.,31
2014.11.07,9,interstellar is a jawdropping aweinspiring beautiful complex and thrilling adventure.the film is a mix of spielbergs warmth kubricks brain and malicks beauty.visually it is one of the best film ever made if not the best. totally is it the best film ever made? i dont know. a film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. may be i need to see it again to find any flaws hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely.  performances were great. hans zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. some of the stuff is hard to understand like the gravitational singularity relativity and 5 dimensional space. but nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. if you are a sucker for these things the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental.  dont miss it. i recommend you to watch it in imax if possible.,15
2014.11.08,8,with earth running out of resources astronauts make a lastditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. this is possible via a wormhole of unknown origin. and it has to work. at its core this is about the love between a father coopmcconaughey an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader and his daughter murphchastain independent and as stubborn as he is. this is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. everything we are excited about rides to some extent on us and them caring about both of them and what they share. thus we never stop caring and it enhances all the thrilling space adventuresalmost exclusively grounded in reality and the best theories where the mastery of movementor relative stillness of the camera and the volume of the soundtrackand sometimes deafening silence builds tension to its breaking point and crucially never beyond it. and unfortunately this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism. the ending will divide audiences. this owes a great and openly acknowledged debt to kubricks 2001 but it isnt a mere tribute to that and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. it goes different places and the third act will be long debated as it deserves. the humor is wellintegrated not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. all of the effects are amazing and the technology compelling. watch this in the theater it is made very much for that as far as the visual and audible experience. the 2 hour and 45 minute running time and thats not counting the closing credits will scare some off and it is perhaps too long. there is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. i recommend it to everyone who doesnt outright hate nolan it is very much one of his films for better as well as worse however even with the hokey aspects this is one you shouldnt miss. 810,18
2014.11.08,10,the most original story i have ever seen and the most realistic view of space ever depicted of film. the complicated plot points in this one is sky high even surpassing the imagination made that based inception. the plot made this movie just makes it harder to direct for christopher nolan. it is not a question that the screenplay of this film isnt the best work of nolan but who the hell cares no one could do it any better than nolan himself with this unbelievable script. i was literally mind blown from the dialogue and script. the movie itself made me question my very existence. this life changing film creates possibilities and new theories on space and time. how gravity and love could help you communicate with the past physically and the concept of the 5th dimension in the black hole that lets you communicate with the 3rd dimension just boggled my mind. it creates goosebumps on what could happen if interstellar travel is possible and if gravity and time relativity could really do equate. the concept of love in this movie as a feeling that even surpasses time galaxy and existence made my eyes tear making it also a great drama. people say that great ideas alone does not make great movies but just the mere fact that this really big idea was portrayed in film is unbelievable and should be given credit for. people compare it to kubricks work but it isnt just a typical 2001 space odyssey clone like most people say it is. it borrowed the same elements but injected in new ones. the truth is i dont want to recommend this movie to any typical moviegoer. the dialogue could be as boring as hell and the movie wont be appreciated on what it really is. this 3 hour long film is for the people who want a new story who wants to widen their imagination who wants to know the value of love. yes it is full of flaws in directing as i explained because of the plot but understanding its urge its ambition you could understand this movies sense and value. this movie is a movie that you can both love and hate whether you choose to see its flaws or see its value is up to a viewer.,18
2014.11.11,10,i rarely go to the cinema any more since i have such a good entertainment system at home. i went to see this movie anyways since i didnt want to wait until it came out on blueray. im glad i did! there is only one thing to say to describe this movie mind blowing! truly mind blowing! i had high hopes for this movie and usually when you go in there with high expectations you almost always come out disappointed. thats not the case with this movie! it was actually far better than i had dared to dreamed about! i couldnt stop thinking about it for days afterwards.  this movie addresses some important questions. are humanity going to stay on the earth? is it safe here? this is a movie about the struggle to survive. but its so much more! its action love hate and even some comedy. this movie has it all! it lasts for 2 hours and 40 minutes but not for one moment does it get boring. there are lots of plot twists that really get your imagination going. the movie makes you do some hard thinking.  not only is the movie exiting and entertaining its also estethicly pleasing! breathtaking is the word of choise for some of the sceenes. not to mention the music which complement the visuals so well. i havent seen a movie so estethlicly well done since 2001 a space odessy. and that movie was famos for just that.  if you havent seen this movie yet do it now! this is the best movie ive seen in a very long time!,26
2014.11.09,10,lets start by saying that i was astonished by nolans vision mesmerized by the visual captivated by the plot and touched by the characters. having waited 11 months for this film and being a huge fan of nolan perhaps i am not able to provide an objective opinion about this film but all i can say is that delivered what i wanted and far more. it was astonishing. so lets start with the cinematography and as usual with nolans films it looks pristine. there was no shot misplaced the tone presented by the camera movements was perfect. every movement had a purpose and there was no unnecessary fluff handheld cameras are used extensively and this gave the film a very pure feel. that being said there were certain scenes were our jaw will just drop. this is partly because of nolans genius use of the camera and also partly because he only uses practical effects which made the entire film feel far more real and tangible. the acting in this film is fantastic the entire sequence between coop and his daughter at the start of the film is genuinely heart wrenching and incredibly well done by both actors and throughout the film the acting never once becomes wooden. a quick mention to hans zimmer for the most incredible score that held together the film and added so much to the feeling of uncertainty not once has zimmer made a bad score and i feel that this is his best score yet. onto the point of nolans films the core focus and what drives the plot is family. throughout the film i feel nolan is saying that through this journey mankind is evolvingtoo say any more would spoil the film and throughout the film there is a sense that every misstep makes the characters better and smarter. throughout the entire film some characters constantly say we did this i theory but it is completely different in reality which i feel shows that as the movie progress so do the characters in terms of knowledge and understanding and by the end of the film some even seem like they are a higher being. however throughout the film none of these high concepts feel like they are out of reach or that the film is impossible to relate to because throughout the film the one thing that holds it together is love and family and unbreakable relationships and this remains a touchstone throughout the film that everyone can relate to and understand the film. let me say this now although it appears to resemble 2001 i do not believe that it does. 2001 is a very clinical detached film which in my opinion is the greatest film ever this film is very different. it may be an incredible space odyssey but unlike 2001 it has blood in its veins and perhaps interstellar becomes too sentimental at points and it compromises the plot because of it but i feel like this is the point of the film. nolan wanted to make an epic journey that could be related toi would argue that 2001 is the greatest film ever but that it is difficult to grasp because of the clinical nature of it. nolan definitely did this with interstellar it is a film that can be grasped and interpreted and related to but he also made a tremendously epic film that i not simple and tackles subject matter that many directors before have struggled to even get a grasp on themselves never mind convey it in a film so grand. is this the greatest film ever o but it is definitely up there and the fact that a film so complex is the largest film event of the year shows that the audiences that go in their droves to see this film arent that stupid either. to conclude i salute christopher nolan for this film it was pure incredible film making the lime of which i havent seen in years the fact that all i have thought about since the screening is this film and that even after 3 hours i still felt like there should be more shows in my opinion just how great a film this is. this is the best film i have seen in many years and it is my opinion nolans crowning work there has not been a film this ambitious and with this complex a vision made so well since 2001. i will end as i started incredible cinema.,23
2014.11.08,10,interstellar an inter galactic space travel to other galaxies through worm holes by other dimension of time using gravitational physics mixed up with time warping and relativity concepts. yeah yeah.... by now you can understand the depth of the movie which nolan wanted to show the world in his latest offering. i went to the film with maximum expectations and it exceeded in every aspect. the plot is quite simple. but the way of execution is complex. the film starts off on a smooth note and the excitement increases as the movie goes. i liked every bit of the movie. matthew mcconaughey is awesome throughout the film as his expression in some particular scenes leave u in an awe. marvellous job by him to carry the film. all the lead cast played exceptionally well. people are asking me whether it is of gravity range??? i simply asked them back why do u want to compare this with that?? i seriously dont like to compare two movies even if they are of the same genre. i dont want to play a spoilsport here so im not revealing or jotting any plot lines here. the screenplay as usually by jonathan nolan is very gripping and he surely does a remarkable job with the script too. another big gem for the film is its bgm. what can i say about hans zimmer which u already dont know? the bgm gelled so well with the movie that u almost think the bgm is a representation of on screen presentation. some scenes got much elevated by the impeccable work of hans. his use of instruments and strings require a special mention. especially during the final 510 minutes of the movie the bgm is so good that it almost left me speechless and haunted me the rest of the day. a huge respect to zimmer. coming to my movie god christopher nolan....... there was a time when i thought what if a directer directs only gentlemen class movies and not the silly stuff to hang around the industry. then i came to know about nolan and his works. at first i was thrilled by his taking and got attached to his movies so much i cant think of not expecting a better output from him in his next.... he is a master in movie making and a true gentlemen movie maker. the reason i used the word gentlemen moviemaker is that his works needs to be understood but not only watched for timepass. every dialog in his movie has a meaning and every frame in the movie has to do something with the plot. in interstellar he once again showed us why he is such a remarkable movie maker and a splendid director by delivering the most spectacular experience of a space travel. the depth of the plot is so well handled. every frame counts and every dialog has a reason. he never even wastes a single second of the film with unwanted stuff. as always the story is to the point and goes on increasing the intensity exponentially. if i say more about the plot i may spoil the experience for some who didnt watch it yet. so all i can say is that this movie is masterclass in every aspect. finally dedicating his own dialog from the dark knight to him i would like to say..... he is a silent guardian of movie making..... a watchful protector of the script...... a dark knight of the industry....... i salute him with all of me and expect many more top notch directional ventures from him. p.s. i pity imdb accepts only 10 starsit may be my exaggeration but this is what i feel. like,46
2020.07.17,7,there are some interesting ideas and some great moments in this original piece of work. ultimately it doesnt quite get there for me though in terms of the overall story and the science. its ambition together with some decent performances along the way elevate it into the above average bracket.,3
2014.11.05,10,i am writing this to just say if you love science and space this is the movie to go watch before you die. i am simply enthralled and it is as i always like my entertainment to be start slowly gradually build up and bam like an orgasm it ends. it is one of the finest movies made in the history. but as many people who went with me couldnt comprehend the sheer genius of the filmmaker and the space time complexity so if you are one of them that dont want to understand and just want something happening that doesnt utilize your neurons then i guess dont watch it. to say the least if i were a girl i would let nolans brain do it with me any time.,5
2017.10.16,6,2001 is my all time favorite movie blade runner is one of my all time favourites too i pretty much loved all nolans movies except for the dark knight rises so theoretically this should have been a great time and great movie... it wasnt the story the science the pace where all wrong in so many ways. i even gave the movie a second chance at home but things just didnt improve i just cant believe this has such a high rating it just doesnt deserve it,3
2014.11.07,2,interstellar while visually stunning is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. flawed because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. when youre a filmmaker who can make anything you want  on film  there is no excuse for your films to atleast bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level. interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft im just shocked that nolan didnt develop this more. the entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead cooper and his daughter  but this is so rushed and honestly extremely cheesy that we dont care what happens. they spend far too much in time in space  with a ridiculous plot involving matt damon  and cut back to earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions. this film proves that the nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things writing females and writing emotional characters that were attached to. the dialogue was laughable  over the top in many places  and basically just a ton of oneliners. we cut from cooper learning he has to go to space  says goodbye  boom on the rocket  no attachment. there is zero development here  just get him to space which fails to tell the core story well  which bites this movie in its ass in the third act.  forced. rushed. however you want to put it  im sorry folks  its not a great movie  not even a good one. everything is spoon fed to the audience  no not just the science  the twists  i didnt know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in hollywood  guess it is. they talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain knew there was something there  and if you know anything about space travel black holes  or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers  can put two and two together and call the major twist in the first act.  come on nolan you can do better.,16
2014.11.07,10,interstellar reviewspoiler alert christopher nolans latest endeavor reaches out into the farthest corners of space quite unlike inception where he plummeted the depths of the human mind. the premise is the oft quoted disaster scenario only this time it appears to be much more realistic with food running out for earths 6 billion inhabitants and mankind seemingly destined to suffocate as the oxygen content of the atmosphere starts to dwindle. however there is a distant hope for salvation a wormhole has been placed in the vicinity of saturn cue 2001 a space odyssey seemingly by some higher beings which may provide an escape route for mankind to reach out to potentially habitable worlds. only if we can overcome murphys law whatever can happen will happen including whatever bad can happen. steps in matthew mccounaughey cooper to head an expedition of 4 travellers dr amelia brandhathawaywho leaves behind her ageing father professor brand aka michael caine romillygyasi and doylebentley accompanied by 2 magnificent robots tars and case although constructed in the spirit of hal these two ai are quite the extreme opposite of hal in every sense. coopers sacrifice is leaving behind his two young childrentomchild timothy chalamet adultcasey affleck and murphchildmackenzie foy adultjessica chastain not knowing if he will ever make it back to them again. crossing the wormhole leads our explorers into a system orbiting a black hole the gargantuan with three potentially habitable planets named after the brave explorers who made a neardefinite oneway trip to these worlds. the movie is a fantastic sequence of interstellar adventures but does not need any aliens to spoil the show does mankind really need an external influence to destroy it when we are experts at self destruction?.  not wanting to spoil the rest of the movie it suffices to say that the final act of the movie is a dizzying sequence combining human bravado survival instincts and love into a heady mix that takes time and possibly repeated viewing to really absorb the meaning of. suffice to say the man who played the priest read man of faith in my erstwhile favourite science fiction movie contact sees his career complete a nice circle by himself making a jump of faith both metaphorically and literally this time. add to this the hauntingly beautiful music of hans zimmer and a couple of wow moments one of which leads to the demise of the antagonist yes there is one and you have the complete package. the last scenes are guaranteed to make your eyes swell up as a satisfying conclusion is reached to this grand tale. mccounaghey and chastain play stellar roles and this film is guaranteed for oscar nomination in multiple categories technical as well as acting. it also demonstrates the superiority of 2d handheld cameras over the current slew of 3d digital shooting and is possibly the last film to be shot on imax. as much as it might seem an action adventure fantasy it is much more a parentchild love story than anything else and may not appeal to all audiences hence the fiercely divisive opinions amongst critics already. over time this shall be acknowledged as one of the masterpieces of 21st century filmmaking much in the way 2001 attained its acclaim years after release.,16
2019.11.05,8,first the good stuff. black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate as confirmed last year by real life observations. this is by no means 2001 a space odyssey just as nolan is no kubrick but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. there are a lot of things that make no sense however first the nature of the apocalypse on earth is completely nonsensical but on the other side the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts especially if you take into account that once you go speculative you cannot be that wrong. there is some sound strong scifi along the way but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too though many are saved by the almost brilliantly consistent ending and a lot of scifi themes are nicely incorporated and shown to stimulate imagination in some capable kids. there is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. the daughter scientist is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for a touche if subtle punch that irritated the critics. extra point for matt damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be. overall a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority.,9
2021.01.19,10,honestly i thought this is just for this movie until i watched tenet and realized that i have to at least watch nolans movies 5 times in order to get more fact.,1
2015.04.13,10,im going to keep it as brief as possible with no spoilers.i went to watch this movie by myself in a small theater on a less populated day of the week just so i could watch it with no distractions and really soak in the movie.i enjoyed every single minute of it from beginning to end.i felt as if i was in the journey along with what the character was going on.it kept me at the edge of my seat and for a moment i almost forgot i was watching a movie and felt as if it was realitycausing me to feel the emotions of the movie as if i were experiencing each moment in first person.the storylinethe themethe dialogthe soundtrack was an absolute masterpiece. bravo !! interstellar you are now in my classic collection.,8
2018.08.12,8,this is a good scifi tale if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours about a mission to save the planet from some disaster either global warming dust bowls or whoever wins the next presidential election. matthew mcconaughey heads the mission along with anne hathaway and a few others i hadnt seen before. they also have a neat robot named tars. they fly off to find some previous scientists who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. matt damon plays one of the scientists. you have to like black holes relativity and the fifth dimension not the pop group to appreciate this. i didnt know a thing about this film beforehand so it was a nice surprise to see michael caine pop up. and when william devane showed up i instinctively blurted out whats in your safe? the special effects are fine but the characters are more interesting and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. mcconaughey is good but he mumbles on occasion which drives me nuts. i liked the music score but at times it drowned out the actors.,11
2014.11.09,10,i knew something about the plot and thought that it may not be anything more than what i knew. but i was wrong! i was amazed at how nolan unwrapped one surprise after another and by the time the movie completed and end credits started to roll i was left speechless for 10 minutes or so. some of the audience started clapping when the movie endedsome just sat on their chairs dumbstruck! outside people were busy discussing the movie that they have just seenit is a rare sight! i was trying to analyse and understand what i just saw. i need to see it another two times at least to understand this amazing movie better! i need to understand the science the movie has spoken about before i can try to understand it! nolan has gone a step beyond what we have expected out of him with this movie. i am amazed at how he can reinvent himself every time! unlike other nolan movies this one is strong on emotions as well..at the core it is father  daughter relationship. we had seen only a glimpse of father son relationship in inceptionthis one could bring tears to your eyes seeing the performance of the actors. i dont like to give away much some pointers by me.. you need to brush up science and know at least the basics like time black holes relativity gravity etc to understand the science part of this movie. do not spread spoilers on this movielet everyone go into the theater with no knowledge of this movie to be amazed like me! watch it 3 times or more times to understand it better!,17
2024.11.20,7,good film. dont get me wrong im a sucker for most of nolans and his brothers works but this one just doesnt rise up to the standard of filmmaking that were used to from these guys. where to start? the overtly obvious and clich ending? if youve seen any movie involving spacetime puzzles and paradoxes you see it coming from miles away. one might say thats not the point of the movie that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. well sorry folks the nolans seem to talk the talk but they cant walk the walk. the dramatic content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. it relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesnt really give us the psychological background of the characters as to why they do what they do. some clich shots explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in event horizon. the girl running after the car of the departing father only to be held by another loved one queue dramatic music wow i havent seen that before. the beings or us in the future simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacitiescome on matthew youve done that movie already! the robots look like monoliths from 2001. well if youre gonna be inspired by kubrick be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece. human nature is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. yeah we have survival instinct also compassion for our loved ones which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. so where are all these forcedtearjerker scenes coming from? what else is new since 2001 or solaris? is that all there is to it? a movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre but instead it is a faint copy easily forgettable. what weve seen previously from these guys in films like the following memento and also in dark knight hell even inception is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. none of that complexity is to be found in this movie. the characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci fi movie stereotypes. the dramatic substance of the movie which is literally thrown to our faces every moment does not live up to the quality of its technical execution. sure the visuals are great but thats to be expected from a 169 million movie.,25
2014.11.14,8,look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. christopher nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings. his films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. and that was the reason i wanted to see this film to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty. i will still give credit to where its due. he really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. basically the emotional device here is that matthew mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time. however the nolanisms come full circle with notsosubtle foreshadowing overly pretentious unnatural dialogue heavyhanded symbolism a really earringing hans zimmer score which make the inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time. i can see that this is a script he didnt really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. however its no 2001 a space odyssey. he should stick to thrillers. sorry.,12
2015.03.15,7,like everyone i was psyched out of my mind for interstellar.i was further psyched when i took a look at this movies rating on imdb after its release.this movies has some good elements but you can clearly identify some of the cons of this movie. the best thing about this movie is matthew mccounaughey who is simply on a roll. his acting was phenomenal. the supporting cast was also great. this movie has a really strong ensemble cast. the score by hans zimmer is really good especially because it merges fluently with the dystopian atmosphere of the movie and the visual are a treat for the eyes along with the cinematography. the direction is good and has nolans innovative touch. now with the negatives.first of all this movie is confusing to the average movie goer. it is confusing because it uses a lot of fancy words and scientific terms to cover its notsointeresting plot.the movie tends to drag on and the dialogue is not that great. also the movie is too complicated aside from the terms used in the dialogue. it is proof that just because a movie is different and overly complex it isnt great or stellar. the movie is a bit boring and tries too hard to impress the viewer by further complicating itself and doesnt quite succeed in it.,16
2014.11.16,1,interstellar by christopher nollan reviewed by svetoslav grigorov first i had to look at the score on www.imdb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true 9 out of 10 me and paul were the only ones who didnt like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. whatever that means i can assure you that i wasam still sober and i am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the kettering odeon cinema. secondly i would like to ask how all these critics made the comparisons with kubricks 2001 a space odyssey and thirdly please you who now read this review tell me that i am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. tell me that i havent lost my marbles tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a house on the prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life or at least 2014 the only answer i can think of is thats why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses.  ok so straight to the point. first 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming dust and the coming famine problems nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere earth is doomed father and daughter found a supersecret location that nasa strategically placed for their eyes only. we see a lot of corn and even the nineties children of the corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an american clichd space marmalade and my best fitting comparison for it is armageddon which is not really a movie but a joke. wormholes saving of the human kind bringing resources plantingreplanting plan a plan b frozen embryos to colonize a distant world overcoming gravity scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera philosophy that kubrick will turn in his grave daddypleasedontgotospacecause im gonnacry bam the watch on the floor i dont wanna see you anymore counting while going into the stratosphere legorobot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. wait wait did i say actors? matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway and michael caine the rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter murph who did her best job. matthew mcconaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad versionface of paul newman cannot contribute to any script lately lets not forget that without the help of jared leto and his masterful transformation in the dallas buyers club his oscar was going to hell. his mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in kentucky and what he is on aboutseriously i needed subtitles to comprehend his actors efforts in such a serious movie. how serious this movie was! i pushed myself to read couple of the serious critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it scientific??? oh man poor anne hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. i felt sorry for her. the script was the hell of the hells. such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. total zero or even below the zero. as i said we left long before the end because my time is precious. i will open isaac asimovs or stanislaw lems short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity yes i felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me. well if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like kubrick moon gravity and even contact and other good scifi dont waste your time and save your money. today we wasted 40 including the drinks the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that i was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. my verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give one for the director christopher nolan who needs a little encouragement and i am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of m. night shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. god forbid that never happens. p.s.dont tell me that i have sat there for 2 its actually 169 minutes hours of a film and it had a great ending cause i dont want know.,33
2014.11.13,10,i watched this movie a week ago as of this writing and purposefully have waited to write this review and not be biased.  first of all the first thing that crossed my mind when i left the session was how much tense interstellar was. it mesmerized me especially after the crew went to space and it never stopped until the film had ended. i was genuinely curious through the whole film of what was going to happen next. the action scenes were memorable. at times the silence the pure silence in some scenes was creepy and i felt that i was genuinely with the crew in the space. there have been a lot of criticism by people to this film because the answers that it gives are simple and cheesy. when watching the trailers of interstellar one of my greatest fears was that it was to dramatic in a negative way by some dialogues like im coming back. when?. but after seeing the film i was satisfied with the answers that it gave me. in a way you have to be open minded to watch this after all the answers although simple are not conventional in anyway and this is i think the main reason why so much criticism. but im truly opened to accept that when we as humans dont know what happens at the first time we do something the sentiment of fear dominates us.  i truly recommend people to watch this movie called interstellar. for me it was a complete experience which i had not experienced before in the cinema. maybe you will be troubled by some or a lot of the answers that the movie gives but i think that the visuals on its own are a sufficient argument to see this. i recommend you to relax and not get worried trying to understand everything. its difficult and maybe youll get frustrated of how hard at times it gets. at the same time it is paradoxical how simple the end is. there are some things that people tend to agree both critics and lovers of interstellar. for example that the film is really ambitious. personally i love when people try so much for something different and outside of the commonplace that we watch everyday and i liked very much those aspects of the films. there are some flaws of the film ? probably almost every film has it. moreover we as humans make a lot of mistakes most of the time. i also think that the aspect of error is being underappreciated by some viewers. even in the end you notice how hard and lost you are. but the brilliance something that really captivated me was the fact that for this complex problem a simple solution was given. how beautiful it is when you take a shortcut and resolve a problem in a way which ever be made before.  dont miss this. love it or hate it worth the time of watching in a big screen with the sound loud and tense. for me it was a true experience and i hope that you feel the same as me. cheers.,32
2014.11.07,10,its exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget its a film  but interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way i had never imagined.  heres the thing about films like interstellar the experience of these films starts way before their release and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. christopher nolan god bless that genius announced interstellar a week after the release of tdkr and since then we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what nolan would do with black holes and time travel and such alike  and what he does is not only brilliant but beautiful in unthinkable ways. i really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film because after a point really i was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. but the cinematography editing visual effects set design the score oh hans zimmer! nolans direction the performances all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. they did their jobs perfectly so honestly i wouldnt be able to find a flaw.  some have criticized the sound design but i disagree it was all just so beautiful. so perfect.  nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. i loved this. i absolutely loved this and i implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really really about. for those who have not seen it please do not read on. just go watch it. a solid 1210  because yes it dares to go beyond. spoilers beyond this point let me shrug off the criticism against it the emotional quotient  love. love is the one thing that transcends time and space. its been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the other parts of it however the many may not have fully understood what nolan was trying to say. think of love as a physical being  an actual something that literally transcends time and space  think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! this whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. being a student of philosophy myself this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dreamcometrue for me. it is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film  it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. this film is a realization in the purest sense  this film goes beyond itself beyond the concept of being just a film. nolan does the unthinkable in the neverending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world nolan finds a middle ground. this film is revelation. wow. just wow.,27
2015.04.17,10,the film is one of the films that gave me ideas on how much powerful it is to tell as well researched story filled with love. for the director i have learn so much from watching his film collection how he use the word powerful from inception said by leo and in interstellar said by anne. the search to me is like finding who really you are in life and when you do always remember you can only stop time from moving when you do what you know love the most. to me interstellar is like is a movie of all time that help you find yourself. i am proud of mr. nolan and since i am in tribeca and he is here i will be happy to meet him and learn more from his art. i watched it twice in one day all i can say is its a move that needs you to watch over and over and over to understand the art of telling a story. i rate 1010 my question for mr nolan is will finding the new life on the other planet stop people from harming nature?,8
2019.02.19,10,i watched this movie four times and every time i feel my soul freezing i have no words to describe this movie like then deserv hug your soul and watch this,1
2020.08.25,10,surreal experience when i watched it at the movie theater. neverforget,2
2023.11.01,8,interstellar is a interesting film that questions the time in space in our reality a film that is straight up visually impressive the story is kind of odd but its still worth in this type of film ever since i saw this movie ive been wondering whats up in space what type of life we can live on space and how is humans can evolve it the only thing that i did not really like was the main character being very one dimensional but other than that this has a very good premise and they will pay the movie that has a very good set up and pay off real well the performance was very very good and direction was... well its christopher nolan 8.510.,3
2024.09.28,7,the movie starts off slow stays slow but finally got my attention and it was still pretty good. the movie as almost three hous long and didnt need to be. this movie must have cost a fortune to make. all the actors do a decent job. matthew is actually perfect for this role. anne hathaway wouldnt have been my first choice for brand. the robot chase made me roll my eyes a few times. other reviewers of this movie are right the visuals are incredible. the wormhole and scenes in outer space are absolutely stunning and received oscars for it. apparently no one has sex in space because there is no sex or nudity in this film. all and all its a pretty good way to spend three hours. i give it 4 out 5 stars.,12
2021.10.03,10,this is the best movie ive ever seen in my entire life. infinity out of 10. this is the 2nd time ive watched it after a few years. yes im into space and everything that comes with it if you enjoy wondering whats out there or whats possible and even somewhat like astronomy or sciene then watch this movie. it will not fail you. i understand some parts are fictional but who cares. it blows your mind i cant even explain it in a review. the fact he lost 74 years of his life went by and hes the same age and lost everything but gained something is unbelievable. this movie is emotionally off your chair compelling an will open your eyes beyond what you thought possible. the actors are incredible beyond excellent. the planet they visited for 23years left me speechless. i cant believe i even wrote this much of a review. enjoy.,13
2015.09.14,6,we cant hear the dialogue whenever they speak i barely can hear what they are saying they have spent too much too make it a great movie and i love almost all nolans movies but this one i was trying to enjoy.... great graphics and story line but the sound............. this is probably submitted by hundreds before me but i just want to add my voice to them i read this audiences have complained about drowned out dialogue and muffled conversations with an overbearing soundtrack that obscures major plot points. but what they do not appear to have realized is that they were experiencing the impressionistic way sound was mixed in the movie i still dont i wanted to hear them speak sorry,4
2014.11.14,3,i heard nolan answer a question about authenticity of the scientific basis of the movie. he fessed to changing things up but then said  and i agree with him  that audiences are ok with if the movie is consistent within itself. unfortunately interstellar is far from consistent. how the black hole is treated in completely nonsensical. light doesnt escape but he and his ship nor the bot are stretched out into spaghetti by the gravity. said hole is at first a safe enough distance away from the ice planet to not be a factor but is then close enough to capture their ship in its vortex.  why oh why did the superevolved humans huh? in and of itself put that wormhole way out in the burbs and then leave a riddle within a black hole on the other side of it if their intention was to save humanity. couldnt they have been just a little bit more direct if they can alter gravity on the micro high resolution level. come to think of it if the point of the black hole was simply to house the library thing why wasnt that simply out in plain view? seems a lot more sensible than having to conjure up the circumstances whereby someone would think that entering and surviving a black hole was possible let alone a good idea?!? and wasnt that actually a wormhole since he was looking in on the room? why did the other one require an acid trip of a tunnel to get to the other side?  why oh why is their only a single person caine on earth working on that gravity equation? oh and then mcconaughys daughter after 40 years which makes two. no mris and they whip up that spaceship presumably one of many in a few years. and suddenly have all that hightech medicine despite the lack of tomography. and cryogenics? and why are they tooling around saturn 100 years after getting mcconaughys message instead going through the wormhole to salvation or even sending anyone else to help out lonesome anne?  matt damon and mcconnaughy wander off on foot on the glacier and yet it takes comparatively ages for the ship to jjet to their location. they must have been fit dudes to accomplish that distance on foot on that terrain. infuriating. the best thing was the music more accurately awesome polyphonic blasts i mean that in a good way. i know it made it hard to hear some of the dialog but that wasnt such a bad thing.,24
2021.05.28,10,one of the best movies ever! the story the actors the effects the camera and all other things simply wow!,2
2023.03.04,10,i rewatched this after 7 years. the first time i watched this a lot of the scientific stuff went over my head even though i have a minor in chemistry. and i felt quite frustrated that i was missing the big picture thinking there were holes in the plot which turned out was caused by my lack of scientific knowledge. as i got older and my love for physics and astronomy grew i was determined to rewatch this movie so it would make sense. watching simple yet informative you tube videos which explained einsteins theory of relativity along with multi dimensions helped me fill in some of plot holes. after seeing it again i was just wow. one of the best movies i have seen. hands down.,8
2020.10.19,10,there are countless reasons why i love to watch movies but interstellar always reminds me why i fell in love with cinema in the first place. there hasnt been a film which hit me as deeply as interstellar. the story has so many layers to it and essential themes like the survival of our species pioneering in order to sustain the human race and ultimately the importance of love to humankind. since it is a scififilm i never expected it to be as emotional philosophical and touching in its core. the most important message it wants to tell us is to grow beyond us and to face the challenges we are most afraid of. furthermore sometimes you have to sacrifice something in order to achieve your goals newtons third law. the cinematography is one of the most beautiful of all time which leaves you in awe the soundtrack by hans zimmer is simple yet absolutely breathtaking. all actors give great performances especially matthew mcconaughey as cooper mackenzie foy as young murph and jessica chastain as adult murph. christopher nolan crafted something special with this film invested a lot into research for scientific accuracy which he used to show us never before seen images which are revolutionary and raise new standards for future space movies. a must watch!,10
2020.09.09,10,i went into interstellar with high expectations due to the story concept and director christopher nolans history of great films. i got the brilliant story and visual spectacle i was hoping for but i didnt expect the gut wrenching emotions the movie would put me through. its true that despite being a masterclass of visual effects and spud design the emotions in the film and the incredibly talented actors that portray them are the main reason to watch this film. it is an unforgettable movie.,4
2022.11.15,10,i sill dont get how hans zimmer didnt win the oscar with those amazing masterpieces that he made in the soundtracks. the film is overall the best film in its category one of the best scifi films that touches your emotions and feelings its one of the most brilliant films that is made by christopher nolan maybe its his best. watching this movie for more than once never gets boring you just figure out more hints and brilliance in directing and storyline. if you havent seen this film yet youre missing a lot. cinematography and graphics are on a whole other level. its comforting to across a movie that doesnt really claim to have any of the answers every time you watch it you just get more questions in your head.,6
2022.02.17,9,wow... im blown away. it lures you in... you think okay this is silly you think you are better than the movie. but then it hits you right in the back of your head.. you look confused.. the movie sneaked up all the way behind you and hits you in the head like you have never been hit before. combine that with the absolutely brilliant soundtrack from the one and only hans zimmer and you got yourself a literal banger. i cried. not a little a lot. very cathartic.,11
2014.12.05,7,caution spoilers ahead! in rian johnsons time travel caper looper old joe says to young joe i dont wanna talk about time travel s. cause if we start talking about it then were gonna be here all day talking about it making diagrams with straws. this certainly applies to christopher nolans latest blockbuster interstellar. in fact instead of wasting time and brain power trying to work out how matthew mcconaughey can possibly communicate with his futurepast daughter through morse code derived from a watches hands via plucking bands of color while trapped in another dimension  or any of the thousands of baffling thoughts that inevitably come with the time travel paradox or in this case interdimensional travel im just going to go right ahead and skip that aspect of the film in this review sparing my poor head and perhaps yours. instead i want to focus on interstellars biggest strength the experience as a whole. shot on 70mm imax film stock the film is just flat out stunning. shots are larger than life every pore on the actors faces can be seen the slight grain and color timing of the print give a warmth to the cold film  something which nolans films generally lack. coupled with nolans insistence on using practical effects over computergenerated imagery and hans zimmers intense scoring reminiscent of kubricks 2001 a space odyssey helps create a simply breathtaking visceral experience. the visual effects are on par with some of the greatest ive ever seen on film. not once was i taken out of the film i was grounded in it everything looked and felt real. directors need to take note practical effects with dabs of cgi here and there when necessary look amazing or in other words stop relying on cgi. clocking in at just under 180 minutes potential viewers might find the lengthy film daunting however the film is surprisingly well paced it doesnt plod or meander. i didnt find myself checking my watch or cellphone at any point hoping for it to end. and i couldnt imagine trimming it any further in fact i hope there is an extended cut in the future to extend a few scenes in space to allow the viewer to take in just that little it more of the extraordinary view. nolan casts a few of his usual bunch in supporting roles such as anne hathaway and michael caine pronounced as my cocaine none of whom elevate above or beyond the material. they just are. though hathaway was especially bland i felt nothing for her  which wasnt the best as im sure nolan wanted us to. she struggles to sink her teeth into and perhaps make sense of a few of the lines while michael caine pulls a morgan freeman and plays his tired old self. it is matthew mcconaughey and jessica chastain who steal the show and i should note that chastain is fast becoming one of the greatest working actresses today while mcconaughey proves the mcconaissance is still in full throttle alright alright alright? my only issue with the film lies with michael caines sudden death after revealing the realities of the mission to chastain. i sat there during his final speech thinking please dont die please dont die but he did and my eyes couldnt help but to roll back and view the dark recess at the back of my head. perhaps the extent of the suspension of belief required for viewing is another niggle but that is ever so slight. the science behind the film made sense when considering the plot but when you start to pick it apart cracks begin to show and it almost comes undone but i feel that its easy to let go of this factor and just enjoy the film for what it is a stunning and spectacular experience. though not without fault the sheer scope and ambition of the film should be applauded. it needs to be seen to be believed. admittedly ive never been a fan of nolans films but he has knocked it out of the park with this one and almost converted me. the question cinema goers are asking these days is do i have to see this in the cinemas? and the answer is yes you do. even if you have a shiny new curved television with all the bells and whistles the experience would not be as grand. this is worth the trip. a solid 810 if you liked this review check out more here www.justathought.co,34
2022.11.06,10,i consider myself very lucky to be able to have watched this masterpiece in a cinema screen when it came out. the experience is out of this world visuals emotions music all over the place. this is nolans best work and one of the best movies ever. congrats to everyone involved in the making of this. amazing acting matthew was so good. the music is an instant classic. i really dont understand some critics that found the movie bad and implausible an all these. its a scifi after all. its excellent in terms of being scientifically accurate and has a brilliant narrative and effective storytelling. who cares if the last 20 minutes are implausible when youre filled with the emotions hit you so hard. do yourselves a favor and go watch it in the biggest screen possible and with the best sound you can have to experience it.,11
2015.12.28,6,i watched this on dvd. the first half of the movie seemed like it needed an intro as to why the world was so devastated. also why there were no threat of violence from gangs hoarding all the resources like most other apocalypse movies? nice human touch but not realistic. we dont know anything about the planet except for the slice of life of a dozen people. what happened to the weather patterns? strike one. how does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. strike two. the middle of the movie was the best part. their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. the ending with morse communication was snake oil and mirrors. where did that multidimensional structure come from? seemed like it came from 2001 space odessey. strike three. the plot leaps from grounded science to twilight zone too often for me. before the movie i was wanting to give it a high grade but i dont think ill even watch it again. anne hathaway bumps it up a notch.,18
2014.11.09,5,special effects are the real winner in this movie not the plot not the acting. most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying except for the ever charming michael caine. the plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950s scifi and less fun. back to the future was and is more interesting. i would have to say it was not a boring movie but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. ann hathaway has no place playing anyone with a phd. the dust bowl effect was not terribly convincing they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. there were too many that wouldnt happen moments for me i couldnt suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. the noise of the background was so loud often i couldnt understand the dialog low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. the characters were doing things that didnt add to the story and just seemed immature you almost couldnt root for the human race to survive.,10
2016.01.22,10,i am not sure if we fully understand the movie or if we should or if we can. its just like watching a beautiful sunset. slow beautiful inspiring and philosophical. the sound and especially some times the lack of it in the space scenarios is amazing. the movie was used as a great canvas for hans zimer to unleash his raging musical art. i recommend watching the movie with an open mind and in an uninterrupted highdefinition format. keep your questions to the end and then look into the imdb forums if still unanswered. some of the earlier scenes in the movie may not be as gripping to an extent that i wanted to take 1 or 2 stars off my review score  but they are necessary in building the characters and an indepth plot.,8
2020.12.28,10,this is truly a masterpiece in an era where movies are made just for special effects and mostly for teenagers. it isnt perfect of course especially with all the technical data but hey this is not a documentary. and so giving it only 9 starts would be a shame.,3
2024.03.06,10,going to a film in a theater is an experience. regardless if the film is good or bad a masterpiece or a failure  when the lights go down  something magical occurs. the audience is taken to new places they discover new ideas or feelings and every few years or so a film can shake your innerbeing to your core. interstellar shook my innerbeing to my core. im not kidding exaggerating or being hyperbolic this film put me in a state that can only be described as transcendent religious even. now nearly one decade after its theatrical release and many rewatches later its still as transcendent as it ever was. simultaneously combining spielbergian warmth with kubrickian opaque mystery christopher nolans magnum opus astonishingly tells a story of intimate love and connection set against a backdrop of vast discovery and uncertainty. never losing sight of constant themes that interweave throughout the film tells a story of potent beauty and understated clarity culminating in a work that never lets go of its big heart and its wild ambition. all of the performances are spectacular especially from matthew mcconaughey mackenzie foy anne hathaway and jessica chastain. mcconaughey my favorite actor of all time brings one of the finest performances in movie history unleashing a sensational amount of emotion that is necessary for establishing the films infinite core. the scenes with him and foy are beautiful sublime and simply stupendous mainly because of the underlying layers that widen in retrospect. anne hathaway quietly stuns with a prime example being a monologue on love that had me quietly weep to myself. nolans direction is beyond words. the wideshots the closeups the alien landscapes the film is visually orgasmic. trust me youve never seen stars look so real. hoyte van hoytemas cinematography is groundbreaking. we thought wally pfister will be missed but he wont. the way the camera flows combined with the slick editing by lee smith makes up a visual experience that is easily the most visually stunning film ever made. yet its the addition of hans zimmers soundtrack that elevates the film into the stratosphere of modern cinema. instantly becoming my favorite soundtrack of all time and definitely one of the finest ever produced zimmers work here is utterly holy and divine. pairing with the immaculate imagery the film releases a poetic feeling of tenderness and sterile majesty highlighting our insignificance in the universe but our determination to overcome our limitations. the story is the finest aspect of this breathtaking work. a journey of the most mindblowing and impressive order christopher nolan asks the audience to take a leap of faith to explore love connection intimacy and the lengths we go for not just others but all of humanity. its all about a relationship between father and daughter. nolan takes the most ambitious genre hard sciencefiction and uses it to discuss why we love and how love will get us further than anything else in our lives. its wholly satisfying pure sweet and stupendously emotional. interstellar is a masterwork a film of timeless beauty and endless innovation. it is my favorite film of all time and i can see it being that way until i settle down for the long nap. a transcendent and moving experience interstellar is the finest film ever made.,29
2022.10.28,10,from the first act itself the movie takes you on an amazing and beautiful journey of emotions and intensity. i might have watched this movie quite late but it was and will always be my all time favorite. cooper struggling to make a decision between his daughter and the world is portrayed so well without a whole bunch of dialogues. the characters are so amazing and you go on this amazing journey with cooper and his team that you almost feel like a part of the crew. the scene with cooper trying to dock the ship with the music in the background is done so well. each time i watch it i clutch my seat in sheer intensity.,6
2019.09.07,10,this was a great movie and one that i wish there were more of. this movie had me thinking the whole time and that is what i loved. the balance between entertainment and brain shaking moments was perfect and is a film like no other. great job to everyone who put this masterpiece together!,4
2021.06.05,10,just watch the movie once you wont regret any second or minute given to the movie ive already watched it thrice unlucky me couldnt watch in cinemas but trust me the fun of the movie is watching it alone on a good display and a good pair of headphones.,1
2021.06.18,7,rating 7.3 this one is special have never seen a space movie so well connected before. the visuals were incredible but the movie falls short in explaining the origins of the conflict why they ran out of food as well as relying too heavily on quantum mechanics and theoretical fiction cooper miraculously redocking to the broken endurance cooper not being immediately ripped apart in the event horizon the 5th dimension time stuff just so cooper could talk to his daughter cooper somehow sending quantum data to his daughter in morse code nobody looking for brand until cooper woke up ect.. the theme of the power of love was wildly cringeworthy but other than that good film.,4
2025.09.04,8,do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day. rage rage against the dying of the light. interstellar is nolan at his most ambitious trying to wrestle with the biggest of questions what place do we hold in the universe and what would we sacrifice to keep love and our species alive across time and distance? at its heart though its the story of a father and a daughter and that thread between coop and murph is what gives the film its soul. those early moments between them are easily my favorite part warm and fragile in ways nolan doesnt always allow himself to be. the film isnt without flaws. the way coops son is written feels like an afterthought as if the script forgot he existed once the bond with murph took center stage. the stacked cast also feels uneven some characters like lithgows appear more as plot devices than real people. and the whole subplot with damons character never fully clicked for me pulling me out instead of deepening the story. what sometimes frustrates me about nolan is also what makes his work stand out. he insists on turning nearly every scene into something monumental and in interstellar that tendency sometimes borders on overblown. yet even when the grandeur feels too much there are moments so visually and emotionally striking that they carry you with them. the visuals are astonishing from the vastness of space to the textures of each planet and the sound and editing give the whole journey a rhythm that feels alive. zimmers score built around that haunting organ might be the most powerful of nolans collaborations. for me interstellar works best not as a perfect piece of science fiction but as a meditation on time and love. when it leans into that when murph whispers across decades and coop stares at the stars it becomes something rare. flawed yes but also deeply moving. a film that rages against the dying of the light.,18
2015.12.28,3,this film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. the magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention e.g. when is matt damon inserted into this?. such a disappointment. im very pleased that i waited until this was available on streaming services. the beginning while slow and lacking character development and somewhat unbelievable is interesting. the end is completely ridiculous. i had a flashback to the fifth element where it was declared that love was the 5th element. too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. the ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. i found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on imdb after being released over 1 year ago! as a scientistengineer i wanted to enjoy this film. i was woefully disappointed. for anyone interested id watch the martian long before watching this drivel. im shocked that this is 29 in imdbs top rated movies how did that happen? brings into question how reliable imdb really is with respect to objective movie reviews.,17
2020.08.28,10,i will always regret that i could not see this film in the cinema,1
2019.09.27,10,probably the best movie i have ever seen in my whole entire life,1
2022.08.17,10,the film starts slowly but its not boring. stability and uniqueness i do feel like this movie could be like last years sandra bullock and george clooney blockbuster gravity. as time goes by i can feel the importance of time which makes my prejudice gradually disappear. with twists and turns but without straining the brain it does put emotion and adventure together.,4
2021.12.09,10,i missed this when it was released in the cinema assuming it was a run of the mill space movie. so sad that i never saw this on the big screen. when i finally got around to watching it boy was my mind blown the movie is practically perfect. it has every element you could want its treats you like an intelligent person when explaining the scientific theories and you feel intelligent understanding them. the acting is incredible and the score just superb. the level of depth this film has really has an affect on you for a long time afterwards. it will take an emotional toll on you so be prepared to have a good cry. this is a movie you definitely need to sit down and pay attention to while watching and i guarantee you will be so rewarded for your efforts. in my top 5 favorite movies of all time.,9
2021.11.28,10,i was enjoying this movie so much that i never wanted this movie to get finished. this is and always will be the best scifi movie ever created. i watched this movie today  28112021  but this movie came in 2014 and now im frustrated that why i didnt watched this masterpiece that time.,3
2018.12.19,6,in the near future the planet earth is disintegrating environmentally. a team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where earths remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive. the first half of the film is fascinating. it has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and overpopulation. there is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. matthew mcconaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. playing his schoolage daughter mackenzie foy is no slouch either. the second half is interesting at best muddled too busy and overlong at worst. there is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized. the movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more.,10
2022.11.29,10,interstellar is a near perfect masterpiece. although the run time can make the film feel a little too long at points and the ending is also slightly drawn out the film makes up for these flaws and shows why christopher nolan is one of the greatest directors and storytellers of this generation. the ideas in the film are very intriguing and make you think for hours after you first view it. upon rewatch the film becomes even more fascinating because of all the things you might have missed the first time through. the emotion showed throughout the film also improves the story greatly. the stakes of what they are trying to accomplish are shown with this emotion with matthew mcconaughy and anne hathaway standing out with their stellar performances. but probably the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and visuals. the visuals are some of the best of any film ever created and are something that really impacts you. so christopher nolans interstellar although with some minor flaws blew me away with its story concept cinematography and exceptional visuals.,9
2015.12.28,6,yes it has an awesome photography. yes it is plenty of awesome actors. and yes it has a pleasant way of using multidimensional physics. but for christs sake did they actually needed a 169 minutes long space movie for stating that love is a very powerful force!? with all the hype and the claims of profoundness ive expected something that actually bore a thousand questions to my mind kept me mentally awake for days not a movie in which the most difficult concept to understand is 4dimensional physics. sadly this wasnt the case.,6
2014.11.09,1,this year is not very good for the scifi cinematography. besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre like xmen days of future past there was actually only one bigbudget movie worth watching on the edge of tomorrow. it seems like tom cruise is one of the few hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. his recent achievements leave little to desire valkyrie or knight and day are good at worst with the high pitch of oblivion. are we able to say the same about matthew mcconaughey?  unfortunately not. although his recent movies are above average true detective or dallas buyers club the latest picture he plays in interstellar directed by christopher nolan and written by him and his brother is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. i dont think anyone being fond of hard sciencefiction stories will like it. here is why. firstly the story. it is in general similar to mission to mars or the red planet where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission which result will impact the whole human race. unfortunately which is the usual problem in this case the whole plot is neither engaging nor entertaining. we have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. maybe because of the long time span of the picture the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. besides the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children which is also a timeconsuming thread here. anyway the main conclusion of interstellar is the banal statement that love is the most important thing in the world. do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this?  by coincidence the second problem is the length of the movie. currently when the the picture is recorded not on the tape but in the digital medium every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might skills or wisdom? i have no idea but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours having the plot for only half of this time. this is exactly the case with interstellar. the presented story is far from complex and could easily fit in two hours. in fact the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences... this film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. unfortunately some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy while others are just stupid. this mixture makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy such movie impossible to attain. on one side we have wormholes black holes higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. on the other hand there is totally unconvincing reality of the xxi century where farmers are more valuable than engineers guys really? and tomography is mysteriously gone. in one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole by the way this scene is identical to the one from the far better event horizon. in another we see the mission robot tars being the member of the crew. i know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today like the one from the day the earth stood still but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in interstellar. it is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! its almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of alien 3... the number of errors and nonlogical events is just amazing. anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in prometheus which was also much better than this one will have the real hunting ground here. in fact the more time passes after seeing the movie the more nonsenses are detected. dont think about this too much anyway its not worthy... the nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story where the word magic interchangeable with nonsense comes to mind. as the result the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... please recall the infamous black hole and you will have the impression of what is going on here... the music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. if the composer knows his craft the soundtrack complements the images creating the flawless combo as was in terminator starship troopers aliens etc.. here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him. unfortunately it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. people like to go to the movies and see a good story. there are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie the mystery the convincing scenery the real characters we could care about finally the emotional strain often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. interstellar does not offer anything of these. it is a long and boring sermon about the future of mankind in the universe pretending to be the sciencefiction movie. with this picture christopher nolan proved his only memorable work was prestige and the batman trilogy was not the accident but the clear sign that his main achievements in hollywood will be too long boring and utterly disappointing pictures initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema but leaving in a complete sad disillusion after all.,51
2021.02.26,9,holy molly...what just happened.... interstellar is an incredible movie with some of mathew mcconaugheys best work ever. they affects were outstanding the science was utterly confusing which is a good thing. i like not knowing everything about the science in sci fi movies. it makes the movie more effective. the music in this movie was almost perfect to the story. i dont think there is anything majorly wrong with this movie. the docking scene in this movie was i think the best docking scene out of any movie. this movie will go down in history for being in the top 3 best sci fi movies ever. good job.  this is in my top 4 for best movies i have ever scene.,12
2025.01.02,10,i cant believe how this film makes me feel and i have watched it at least five times. this movie should be considered one of the best if not the absolute best movie ever produced. it took me through feelings i didnt know i had in my old sour age! humanity can be brutal and beautiful. the way it makes you feel as if youre there having this experience with these characters. ive never really reviewed anything so i probably sound uneducated compared to professionals. i wish i could have first experienced this at a theatre especially imax. anyway hope you read my thoughts and it helps you decide to watch for your first time.,8
2024.08.17,10,a movie who will become buried inside your head. it starts with being a little confusing but this movie will test your focus and your ability to stay focused and keep your concentration if i could i would watch it again you may see it last a little over 2 hours but not 2 hours youll regret. this is what i would call a movie not some kind of joke produced show this is quality all way through and if youre reading this and not knowing if you should watch it i can almost guarantee you that youll like it and one day maybe this movie will be gone and you will regret not having watched it watch it.,3
2022.02.19,10,the first time i watched this film i felt extremely underwhelmed. it was boring dragged out and too confusing and i stopped watching before the 3rd act which imo is the best act. maybe 2 months ago i rewatched it thought i would give it another chance and it was soooooooooooooooooooo good! the performances were great the story made sense and it was one of the only films where i was completely immersed to the screen along with jurassic park aliens. 2001 a space odyssey and the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring. the visual effects are extremely good and the writing was great. i felt that the second act was a bit flawed in terms of scripting and directing imo the weakest of the 3 acts but is still fantastic nonetheless. interstellar manages to make you completely immersed into the screen which only very few films can do. this film truly shows the genius of nolan making him my second favourite director of all time favorite being spielberg. hands down one of my top 5 films. hands down the best christopher nolan film in my humble opinion the dark knight being a close second. one of the greatestepic of all time hands down.,12
2021.02.03,10,the nolan brothers have made a piece of history. thats all i can say to help you understand how extremely well done this movie is.,2
2021.05.27,10,one of the best movies ive seen. a masterpiece from every angle. i never get tired of watching it.,3
2015.09.11,6,interstellar as a movie wasnt bad at all. my only problem with the movie was how the story conveyed the perspective of the gloominess and the extended boring and silent moments that made it less interesting. another problem was the ending it was totally unexplainable and lame. so why do such a great movie then ruin it with such unnecessary strange anonymous ending with anne hathaway living alone in a seemingly depressed way while matthew mcconaughey is living in another spiral world and all of a sudden the end?! unless theres a sequel thats unacceptable.  i know that some may enjoy the visuals and the idea of the after world but thats simply letting the viewer feel in some way empty and kind of regret watching a movie that may be overrated a bit due to the scenes i have mentioned before.,6
2023.12.14,10,at first i thought it was an overrated movie but when i came to watch this masterpiece i was flabbergasted! i felt in so much of different stage of emotion. the casts were great and the flow of the movie and the twist its beautiful it is a lot to take but a lot to take a moment of. a must watch movie! i would have never imagined on how the story goes i thought of it as a typical scientific movie only but never have i ever imagined the story behind will take me to different dimension of emotions. more than excellent and amazingly made i could say. this deserved its hype and love more than ever!,7
2014.12.19,7,i will begin with the bottom line  yes the movie is good it does give you an enjoyable movie experience and yes you should watch it. and yet it does not worth its rate of 910. the movie itself is pretty normal with regular scenes and some few scenes which made people really like the movie. these scenes are rather few in number but are placed in strategic times in the movie giving it its peaks at the exact time you need it. what most people forget is that the entire movie up to these scenes is just a regular every day science fiction movie. i think everyone is so praising it because their friends are saying it who heard it from their friends and so on... i hope you enjoy the movie but dont be blinded by what other people think of this movie.,7
2014.11.14,1,i watched this movie yesterday. i was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so i was expecting a perfect movie really! before i continue i must say i really love scifi movies and i am deeply interested in black holes time travel wormholes interstellar traveling. wow i couldnt think twice this could be the perfect fit for me! i had really high expectations. for the entire movie i was feeling like the best part of the movie should soon but never came. i had hard time understanding what was really happening and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love confusing speeches formulas. all i wanted to see was the wormhole travel spacetime and gravity distortion galaxies nebulae etc. i mean i wanted to see what is in the deep space and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us. spoilers ahead maybe the movie drove me nuts or i lost interest but after they crossed into the new galaxy all i felt was confusion. i never understood what was really happening what were they rescuing what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them why was there a black hole? even i tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie i failed.  what i disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something amazing and new was not successfully transmitted to us. i wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but i failed. instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. not to mention the multiplot scenes after the fight totally no sense. please dont get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad i did. this is reason i signed up at imdb first review to warn others. the idea of the movie is fantastic but poorly developed and acted totally confusing too much clich. watch it but dont have high expectations as me you will be disappointed.,20
2023.05.01,10,this is probably my favourite movie of all time. not only is it my favourite movie its also the best space movie. i watch it every year in april around my birthday and this year was no exception. i have seen it eight times now and it is still fantastic. i get chills and i cry every time. the acting is phenomenal and matthew mcconaughey is one of my favourite actors. the story is wellwritten and it also raises so many questions about space and our place in it. the pacing is perfect. the movie gets more and more interesting and exciting by every minute and there are a lot of minutes in this movie 169 minutes of goosebumps! it has one of the best endings i have ever seen in a movie. its so emotional. the first time i saw this movie in the theaters my mind got completely blown away. if you are a fan of christopher nolan and interested in space you have to see this movie! 1110!,14
2021.11.26,10,first off i must apologize for the morbid caption. but the truth is this movie was not only a masterpiece in scifi cinema but it was a masterpiece as a movie in its own right. i am writing this review in november 2021 having just finished interstellar again. i believe this is my 3rd watch. i am one who likes to savor movies and take my time to dissect every angle and even now this movie still stands the test of time and will for many years to come. the combination of zimmers score and christopher nolans directionstory telling was just a match made in heaven. everything was beautiful crafted well paced and well delivered. the score will haunt you long after youre done watching this. masterpiece as a word doesnt do this movie justice. death we know is inevitable for everyone but while you are here watch this movie. you will be glad you did. as a word of advice try to avoid spoilers. a perfect 1010 for me.,13
2022.07.04,10,time can stretch and fold but it cant go back. it was so beautiful so powerful it took my breath away. but everything is preordained and the survival of civilization depends on the tacit understanding between father and daughter and that doesnt move me.,3
2025.10.30,10,it reminds you of what creativity is. you dont see anything unique in movies anymore they all look the same and become boring. even in some very good movies of the past five years  you know what youre going to see and how theyre going to end. the interstellar its an unforgettable film and i can truly say even though i was the last to see it it was still worth it in 2025 and i can imagine how much of a hit it was when it was released in 2014. i dont think there will ever be such unique films again. hans zimmers music as you know is fantastic. ive heard it many times before i saw the movie and im sorry i saw interstellar late. i was little when it came out. all i have to say is that we should respect these films. unfortunately in my generation few of us respect them.,10
2022.05.19,10,christopher nolan dives into the human desire for survival with pioneering performances by matthew mcconaughey jessica chastain and anne hathaway. interconnected with astrophysics and astrobiology interstellar provides a grounded sciencefiction approach to the exploration of space. brilliant dialogue heartfelt themes and a beautiful orchestral arrangement by hans zimmer drive this visually stunning movie.,3
2015.10.24,6,this film was actually not as bad as some of the directors other flops having some emotional moments and one interesting character that was murphy being decently casted. the relationship between the father and his daughter had the entire film afloat and kept me going despite its many flaws.  the issues with this film are typical nolan first of all repeatedly bad casting. during the first 20 minutes i was still trying to get over mcconaughey being an astronaut. you could at least try to get rid of the heavy cowboy accent... then every scene is dragged over half an hour for no reason. you can take a nap occasionally and check in to see whats changed. is mcconaughey back home yet? no? ok. then you have the music. goodness what? its too loud i cant hear what youre saying! some sound check wouldve been nice. in addition some of the action scenes were completely out of sync with the music score. then you blink and matt damon is suddenly in the movie. what is damon doing here looking very old... wait what is happening now... is he gone? ok. then the movie turns to 2001 kubrick and i wonder if mcconaughey is going to turn into a baby. thankfully he didnt. finally if you made it this far you get some closure with mcconaughey and his daughter. worth the wait? if you take many breaks and have a free afternoon why not.,25
2021.12.31,10,im not a big fan of movies as a whole but when one shines through you just know its exceptional. this is now my favorite movie of all time and it truly deserves it. from the beginning i was gripped introduced to a likeable cast of characters placed into an interesting reality that compelled you right through. from the get go the writers allow us to naturally connect with the characters. we see an interesting take on the fatherdaughter dynamic and as the story continues i balled my heart eyes especially when cooper failed to fulfil his promise. a great mix of a plot and emotional connection. through out the movie i was anxious of what would happen next often seeing illogical reasonings behind things i thought the movie would collapse into itself. i was wrong. with each passing minute the inner conflict of the characters along with the soundtrack that fits perfectly with each of the scenes allowed for a well executed plot. then the highest high of the movie the scene where cooper enters the black hole is one of the best scenes ive ever experiences. i had chills through my whole body the whole time. that is when i knew this is cinema at its peak. i will await a moment that will surpass this as i watch more movies but for now all i have to say is peak cinema.,13
2019.02.12,6,love saved the universe. love. im fine with the idea of love being a powerful emotion but as a scifi especially a quite serious one with wellrespected scientist as its scientific advisor it is quite cringy to have personal love as core of human survival in a cruel universe.,3
2014.11.14,1,this is weird... i love science fiction and i love astrophysics but disliked everything about this movie. the start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. the second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap ripoff of space 2001. the movie just didnt do it for me at all and the acting was average. im totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality storyline plot acting and uniqueness  as this movie doesnt have any of it. ah well i guess ill just have to wait for the next sf movie and hope it will be somewhat better because i am deeply disappointed by interstellar as i expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of 165 million.,8
2021.11.18,10,people who score this below a 9 clearly dont understand the movie  if you think its science fiction then you are wrong. movie experts trying to find plot holes.... are probably the same people who dont get vaxed.,3
2022.11.26,10,this film is definitely a masterpiece where each of the elements converge in a masterful way. the music the actors performances the visual and digital effects are premium everything absolutely everything is carefully constructed. the way that story surrounds you at the moment you start to comprehend it. even you believe everthing that is happening in front of you the places are beauty the production design is so clean everything in this film is perfect. we can fall in love the physics and try to learn for find another solution to the main plot. i still feel the tears run down my face great movie.,6
2019.09.27,10,so many feelings throughout this movie...the time concept was especially mindbreaking. wonderfully written  and finally not a trace of unnecessary romance to be found! this film kept my attention the whole time i was hesitant to even move during some parts. amazing soundtrack and visuals. 1010,6
2021.03.11,10,i dont know how many times ive seen this film now partially or in full. tonight i flicked the channel over and there it was at the docking scene.... its not possible.  no its necessary..... i need to go to bed but how can i even though i have a copy i can watch any time? this film is by far one of the greatest i have watched. it just does something for me i love my scifi that helps. im not a film critic im not able to analyse a film to depth of someone qualified to do so by title but i love my films and i love being immersed in something that surrounds you entirely. the score listen to hans zimmers soundtrack on its own track 8.... mountains... the cinematography the worlds created the scenes on the planets the black hole the seemingly interlinked relationship between the earth story and the space story and most of all the homage to arthur c clarke. im not sure why he isnt referenced or out there in discussions that i can find but a large part of this film was written by him indirectly! anyone whos read odyssey or rama will know this. what christopher nolan has done to make this his is amazing in its own right. i know there are some critics but for me this film was 46 years in the making and i can only thank clarke and nolan for it.,15
2023.01.07,9,the story of the film is very touching. if we remove the music from the movie it will still be a good movie even a better movie maybe even a weak point. well now if we remove the music we see that it is longer. and maybe it will be boring for the audience who likes this big movie several times. the final sequence of the film turns into a package full of long shots. such a show is repeated in different parts of the film. even in the views we have from space. nolan sprinkles a silver and gold color on these shots. men in spacesuits look much bigger than normal. matt damon is not believable enough. but it is good. the sequences size are too long. nolan tries to make it bearable with music but he doesnt succeed. i am not against this. but this work also requires a slower rhythm. the pictures are very beautiful. and they often dont look like promotional teasers...,17
2021.05.25,10,this movie made me think that there are some directors who are talented to a different extent.,1
2015.01.24,7,if you deconstruct the movie then most of its pieces are great in their own way visuals music score casting acting story etc but the problem for me is that the pieces dont fit together and even overload the whole thing in a baroqueesque way. i like it simpler but i can enjoy more elaborate movies though nolans mo is just so recognizable that you cant help to identify the issues while you are watching. his opulent screenplays paired with stunning visuals and grandiose music scores push the inconsistent characters in the background and the plot is kept ambiguous enough to never fully commit to one story and interstellar is no different. still it also had a few things to it i liked for instance the story concept itself or omitting sound effects in space scenes like it would be in a real vacuum or touching on a few political topics with current relevance. so all in all its worth watching if you have 3 hours to spare.,5
2020.10.11,10,never saw my future to be presented in such a realistic way... just awesome movie.,2
2014.11.12,6,ok so i had the great good fortune to see kubricks 2001 when it first came out and you didnt so this is what 50 years of cgi has brought us. everything is possible technically so nothing can astonish us anymore and this derivative forced march tries to bludgeon us into submission with blatant theft from ken burns dust bowl to maudlin appeals to the emotion of loss of children or parents to science gibberish that makes our heads hurt. at least 60s hippies had pot to explain their reaction to 2001 while you could spend an evening of trivial pursuit listing all the pop movies from which this one stealscircular space station on which we now live check secretive but benevolent nasa check suspiciously solicitous robots check crazed astronauts check trippy special effects check. and if you want to see whom our hotshot lincoln pitchman is trying to channel check out sam sheppard as chuck yeager in the right stuff. just because you never saw or have forgotten the pioneers doesnt mean the latest blockbuster is the last word in genius. ask yourself 50 years from now will you remember seeing this the way people remember first seeing 2001 or even star wars? thought so.,7
2014.11.10,1,in the opening night i walked out from the movie theater totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance. poorly developing plot immature explanation of astrophysics unbelievable and unrelated events and characters especial effects leveled to a disney comedy and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression.  even mathew mcconaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter older than himself. mat damon probably did his careers worst acting. the robot was another annoying part. what did anne hathaway and two other guys add to the story? using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an intergalaxy spaceship??? finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole in another galaxy seemed easier than finding an atm machine in a us interstate highway.  why would a director hire a blackholeworldexpert as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? just reading the worm hole article in wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge. mr. nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message awareness of climate changes saving human species teaching relativity theory to common movie goers or the power of love. each of them bold and superficial.,13
2023.12.17,10,possibly nolans finest. the film lives with me forever. its so much more than a space movie. a film about love about how insignificant and fragile we are yet beautiful and capable of magical things. it has moments of joy excitement despair. the soundtrack is timeless how nolan has the vision to create something like this which resonates on so many levels i will never understand.he simply is a genius and hans zimmers score matches his genius to perfection. i look forward to the day when my second child is old enough to watch this film with me the reason being they will finally learn what they mean to me. our child is called murph.,9
2019.01.15,8,i really liked the idea and the plot full of unexpected points and developments. especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. i dont give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant like in other nolans movies.,3
2022.07.28,9,interstellar is a science fiction movie about a team of astronauts who journey through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. director christopher nolan shows us a dystopian world where dust storms have destroyed earths crops. the situation is so bad that the government decides that mankind needs a new home among the stars. matthew mcconaughey plays the leading role as the brave astronaut chosen to save mankind. one of the best movie ever made must watch.,5
2022.03.28,10,christopher nolan is my favorite director. he made such a perfect job at this movie. you will find every feeling you wanted at this movie except love. anyway you will love this movie. this review will be updated.,5
2021.09.18,10,when i watched this gem for the first time i watched it again the same day because i was like woow what was that...complete satisfaction and confusion science and love mixed together and this concentrated mixture will give you an ultimate feeling.,2
2020.12.29,10,worth watching a million times. each time you watch its a new movies. it is shot as a documentary every time when i watch the movie the emotions connects within me at a deeper level which is just mindblowing. the spectacular screenplay from the nolan brothers along with han zimmers music makes it a masterpiece. the screenplay itself has many layers to it. film has beautifully portrayed the relationship bw a man  his daughter as she grows up. my only regret is not being able to watch this movie with all its spectacle in pure 70mm imax. last scenes makes even the strongest of minds to cry.,8
2020.07.26,7,i gave it a 7 because i find some of the relationship dynamics in the movie to be an unnecessary irritation. the movie could have been a masterpiece without the histrionics. maybe they just didnt ring true or maybe they didnt add much to the story. maybe in the case of the daughter it was just so much negativefeeling bunk that really distracted. its too damned bad. this is a largecanvas film and it was diminished. i think thats because instead of infusing our characters with some nobility we were treated to whining and supposed realistic human behaviour. i gotta say if youre aiming high dont sabotage your attempt with the low human characteristics. give us something to feel good about. this movie seems to be about people attaining their goal despite being merely human. darned shame wasted opportunity. i felt irritated often throughout the movie and didnt feel like cheering at the end. great cast though. even matthew mcconaughey had his more irritating acting twitches reigned in by christopher nolans directing skill.,14
2022.12.09,10,loving how they are telling the story about how signs could be a way for the other side to communicate with us here on earth beautiful music and fantastic acting i was struck by how interesting ideas they have presented in this movie and i feel there is many layers to the film. what happens when we die and if we do not age when we are on different planets what happens to us and to our loved ones that are on earth it made me think of my father who has passed away and my wish to communicate with him i like the music and soundscapes that they are adding onto the visual scenes it makes it all more real.,2
2020.06.05,7,interstellar good film but last scene is stupid i dont understand but i like it of course watch this movie,1
2015.08.24,4,a couple years ago there was a major motion picture called cloud atlas. never heard of it? thats because it bombed. it was a threehour marathon of six nonintertwining stories one of which held my interest. the least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idolworship on the big island of hawaii. i wrote at the time that tom hanks and halle berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. the dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. i couldnt believe warner brothers had actually greenlighted this project. now ive seen something similar. christopher nolans interstellar is a threehour convoluted mess of science fiction with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. to wit in the future the world is approaching the end of its habitability. i dont know why. it has something to do with crop blight but if the explanation was in the script i must have missed it. nasa has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. impossible you say? ah but there is a wormhole near saturn which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. a wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time based on einsteins theory of relativity. think of it like han solo traveling at warp speed only its supposed to sound more plausible. im not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time when in reality they must have been lightyears apart from one another. the alwaysreliable matthew mcconaughey plays nasa pilot cooper and anne hathaway is amelia a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. in the best decision writers jonathan and christopher nolan made no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. i only wish they had done a better job of explaining what interstellar is all about. after landing on one of the planets cooper and amelia meet up with another scientist dr. mann played by matt damon who was stranded on a previous mission. in the strangest plot twist dr. mann tries to kill cooper for some unexplained reason. up until this point i believed i could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend interstellar. but why wouldnt two nasa employs be able to work together? is it because nolan wanted dr. manns shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? could be. unlike last years excellent gravity interstellar is a loud busy picture overstuffed with special effects unnecessary music and screaming characters. eventually cooper and amelia venture into a black hole yes on purpose dont ask why where time appears spatially allowing cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. ironically we see this warning at the beginning of the film before the voyage even begins. it doesnt make sense then but for my money it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. somehow cooper doesnt age yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. again it has something to do with einsteins theory of relativity  and therein lay the problem nobody understands the theory of relativity! all the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast which eats up most of the dialogue sounds like a bunch of existential mubmojumbo from the original star trek series. its impossible to follow due to its complexity yet its impossible to suspend disbelief because the plot is so outlandish.  coming on the heels of alfonso cuarons far superior gravity last year interstellar pales in comparison. much as stanley kubrick did in 2001 a space odyssey cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. gravity was a quiet reserved film which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. interstellar is blaring and assiduous  like a semiserious star wars crossed with the garbage science of star trek. interstellar is an oldfashioned saturday matine revved up past power ten with topnotch actors imax special effects and a music score that just wont stop. interstellar is so big and expensive it was financed by both paramount and warner brothers. its moviemaking on a grand scale. and at that level it fails. it might have worked had it simply been stripped down a notch or two.  and its probably just me but i have a problem with the name. why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? interstellar what? wheres the evasive noun? probably sitting on the cuttingroom floor with einsteins theory of relativity.,53
2021.12.10,10,oh my goodness! what an incredible film! i am a pretty big fan of nolans works this is probably my favorite one yes better than inception and dark knight. i enjoyed just about everything in this movie the characters the plot the filming the intensity the emotion the score and the visuals were all absolutely stellar. they were all very spectacularly made. it was just a movie that i could just sit back relax and watch and not search for every incorrect miniscule detail. now it probably isnt the most interesting thing for kids and the ending makes a perfect storyline go a little wonky. a small understanding of space time goes a long way into understanding this movie so i get where some people are coming from. but seriously please go watch this movie it is definitely one of the best ever made.,9
2021.12.17,10,this movie made me think of a different dimension. after watching this movie i felt a lot of things about the universe and the existence. and also showed the value of farmer in our future for living on this earth.,3
2022.07.04,10,i have a weird routine of watching this movie every year and i am still nuts about this movie. the concept of time travel and gravity have always boggled us. what if all of it is real? what if part of the movie is nonfiction?,4
2022.03.03,10,its called nolans movie its been a great movie since the trailer came out. personally ive watched almost every nolan movie and enjoyed every single one ive ever seen because i like scifi movies space makes me like interstellar and in movies there are many aspects of interpersonal relationships but its the uncomplicated relationship that keeps the movies main focus on science. the concept of the movie is quite different from the others that ive ever seen. the relationship between time black holes technology of the future. its something i never thought it would have but it is a science that is not so complicated that it makes people look confused. the story is explained and contributed to the audience to think for themselves. the movie tells of a world inhospitable due to plant diseases. force former nasa astronaut cooper to explore new stars to keep humanity alive. in this movie i loved the scene where a group of astronauts landed on a planet for about half an hour but when they come back the earth has been passed for many years. i find it very interesting to play science with time because there is such a thing in the real world and the scene where cooper falls into a black hole i feel sparkling. although in fact we dont know exactly what will happen if we enter a black hole. all of this makes it my favorite scifi movie of the year and ill go back and watch it often. anyone who is worried that they will be confused by the story or not understand can watch it at all because the texture is not complicated and when solving the clue everyone will feel very sparkling eyes. i want everyone to open their minds and this movie is sure to be a scifi movie thats in everyones heart.,14
2018.10.28,10,a thought provoking emotional rollercoaster. mcconaughey is superb. if you like scifi and know how to invest emotionally in a movie  give it a spin. i can guarantee that even if you dont love it youll finish with an appreciation for the scope of what it tries to achieve.,4
2021.05.29,9,you should watch this movie with its original sound to get the movie experience.,1
2019.12.18,6,im going to admit im not the biggest fan of nolans work. i dont consider him a bad director its just his kind of work its not for me. interstellar is not an exception. continuing in nolans line the movie has a long long introduccion. yeah thats not necessary bad but the problem is you could quit 20 minutes and it wouldnt affect the main characters. of course you must to know what you have to dispense. you can see a little poetry in mcconaugheys character. as the movies moves on the character gets tired and so do the actor. not something bad even it can be very cool for someone but i just dont like to see matthew tired of acting in some scenes in the second but especially in the third. youll see im not criticizing bad things. im just saying things that i dont personally like so its my point of view. sometimes the movie tries to blow your mind. and sometimes it makes it. for example with the last scenes. so whats my point? my point is that if youre a nolan fan go and see the movie. if you like some space misteries like my case well... maybe you dont get as much as you want. this is just a nolan movie. and this is just my opinion.,20
2015.03.17,10,this is one of the best of nolans and you could say one of the best movies that ever came out. you can bet on that! i see this movie as his passion just like his other movies such as inception the following mementoof courses is a must his batmanseries. it creates a visual awe and you find it a complete movie. the science explained here for example  the black hole and the worm hole are astounding and visually amazing ... just amazing! the humanity explained here the suspense that comes till the end the crops shown the gravity astounding and astounding and m still in awe after watching this movie.i dont wanna spoil by saying the rest of the story lol. just watch it this is a must watch for everyone.,9
2018.05.21,7,well it did go on too long but i enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. it dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. i also didnt think it had an ending. it kind of stopped.,4
2023.06.24,5,love is the one thing were capable of perceiving that transcends time and space. void. then as the monologue continues the void is filled with cringe. oh nolan i think to myself. will you ever be able not to take gigantic resources as means to tell overcomplicated spectaclecentered stories that lack emotion?. but of course these thoughts probably wont reach nolan anytime soon and my internal monologue will only be shared with you guys. lets get into it. interstellar is a 2014 film directed by the beloved and critically acclaimed christopher nolan. the movie follows a group of astronauts on a race against time to save humanity from extinction looking for a new home planet for our race. apropos a race against time time has a lot of meaning in this film  a foreboding looming presence that you fight against a sacrifice you make your oneway ticket to the end of everything you know. at least this is what the film is trying to communicate. nolan who has delivered great material in the past as of the time im writing this review memento is in my top 15 films of all time but also lackinginemotion overcomplicated stuff the prestige being a prime example of that and i think i mightve been a little soft giving score to this film. i recommend reading my review to the prestige for more insight about the way nolan approaches cinema but in short i think that nolans biggest problem is looking at cinema as if it was a magic trick as if the only thing that matters is to surprise and amaze. his way of doing that is turning to spectacles to complicated concepts with cool visuals but by doing so he often compromises the emotional aspect of the film and the flow of the story too. in this case i feel like most aspects of the film are just okay just there to support those massive moments regarding time and space. the amount of work going into some of the visuals is truly magnificent but i feel like i cant be moved by this film not really. the characters are far from being three dimensional or interesting only managing to be just a little above the bare minimum needed to sustain the plot. the dialogue is nothing more than okay  decent at its best moments cringeworthy at its worst. i mean the only thing truly working here is the films way with the most epic moments of the story the moments that make you feel how powerless how small humans are in comparison to the universe in general. ill also admit that the pacing felt much worse on first watch when so much of the film went on and on about scientific terms and laws of physics the dialogue felt super forced here and then tried to push this halfbaked philosophy about the importance of love which was forced too and definitely felt like nolans poor attempt in finding an excuse to this films concept that i felt like it just crawled sometimes. on rewatch you know what to expect and i could let myself enjoy the more fun moments the grand moments easing into the spectacle as much as i could. still  spectacle doesnt compensate for the dryness of anything else. this is maybe to worst thing about this film  it thinks its deep or smart when it isnt not at all. the grandest moments work best the philosophical moments or the moments in which the film tries to outsmart the viewer...well this is nolans biggest weakness as a director. its not horrible but its disappointing in its utter mediocrity. im feeling a 5.710 on this one.,28
2025.08.20,10,interstellar is not just another movie that is really good. it is a masterpiece of cinema with insane visuals and a plot that gives you a feeling that you cant really explain something that isnt with regular movies it gives you a kind of hope. the most psychological film in existence you really have to think about it in order to feel the sheer impact this movie brings. you cant say that this is a good movie you have to rewatch it and think about it hard. not only is the movie a masterpiece the visuals are as well. the black hole scenes and the last planet they go to are such iconic and stunning things to experience and watch. the haters will say things like and i quote its okay when they talk pseudo scientific goobleygook when its star trek because they have pointy ears. people who say that have no reason to. like i said you have to really think about it. in comparison to other top christopher nolan movies like the dark knight or inception i can reasonably say that this is his best movie. the dark knight i was biased to because i dont really like superhero movies. inception was also really good but it didnt give me the same rush as interstellar because unlike interstellar its not scientifically accurate. thats also a reason i love interstellar. everything that happens in that movie could actually happen. well my yapping is over. you can tell that interstellar is my favorite movie by miles. before i close out my review i will say this. do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day. rage rage against the dying of the light.,19
2022.08.16,10,without a doubt this is one of the best science fiction films ever made. although the feelings of the father and daughter play and did not move me but gorgeous space let me fascinated.,2
2022.12.05,10,just rewatched this absolute masterpiece in cinma and god what an experience the only question while im watching how nolan did this movie. imo if theres any show could be perfect and almost had no mistakes id gladly say its interstellar no other show did what interstellar did to me full of emotions that can do deep into your hart and your felling great soundtracks and one of the best soundtracks of all time touching stories fantastic acting perfect end which has lots of meaning.. i laughed i cried i smiled i had lots of different feelings but the only feeling that i know for sure after this rewatch is interstellar is the greatest of all time.,3
2015.03.18,10,i have to be honest when i saw the trailer i thought the film would be very monotonous so i was wonder if i would watch the film eventually i am started to watch the movie right from the first minute i thought it was really a great movie not only because i am super interested in what plays in space and i love very much adventure films but also because its a bit the real life of an astronaut describes the say goodbye to your family for example and not being able to promise when you come back and if you come back at all also i found that the film contained a lot of variety. and by that i mean that there is always a different kind of problem came or the planet was not viable or the spaceship went piece i thought it was really super that they have made almost 3 hours full of excitement at the last 50 minutes it was really kind of mind fck because i didnt know how it could be that he was in a 5 dimensional space but good in other words i found a super movie and i really hope there is a interstellar 2 comes!!!,2
2023.11.06,10,interstellar proves that science fiction can be packed with not only visual effects but also deep thought. the film boldly tackles scientific concepts and concepts. it conveys complex topics such as the bending effects of time and the theory of relativity to the audience in an understandable way. however interstellar is not only a scientific lesson but also an emotional journey. the main character coopers matthew mcconaughey relationship with his family and his bond with his daughter murph played by jessica chastain and ellen burstyn are touched upon touchingly throughout the film. this makes the film not just brainburning scifi but a story imbued with universal themes such as human togetherness sacrifice and love. visually interstellar delivers breathtaking scenes. journeys into deep space and alien planets create unforgettable moments in cinema history. hans zimmers music makes the film even more impressive. in conclusion interstellar is a masterpiece of both science fiction and cinematic art. christopher nolans directorial talents the performances of the cast and the deep themes covered in the film offer viewers an unforgettable experience. after watching this movie you may start thinking about the secrets of the universe.,12
2022.11.13,10,interstellar is a movie that evokes instant wonder and hope within us all. for me this film along with its stand out cast  especially mathew and anne  is a spectacle for the ages... the plot the cinematography and not to mention music master hans zimmers out of this world film scores  the film just perfect. every single time i hear the films soundtrack i get instant goosebumps. my entire life i have been absolutely fascinated by space and this film only made me even more fascinated. like any christopher nolan film this movie is guaranteed to have you intrigued from start to finish and this ending is one of my absolute favourites. if you are up for a movie that will leave you mesmerised this is the film for you. interstellar will always be a favourite for me.,8
2014.12.03,6,i found this movie slow and tedious in the first 20 minutes or so and at times during the rest of the movie. i also thought the last quarter or so of the film was bizarre. as for the soundtrack nothing special. i did appreciate that a lot of philosophical questions arise as one watches this movie regarding humans place in the universe and the physical size of the universe and time. on the other hand i also had the feeling that i was watching an updated version of 2001 a space odyssey particularly with the sequence through the wormhole in this movie versus the stargate in 2001. also the similarity of the rectangular shapes of the robots to the obelisk and a few other minor similarities.  all in all i felt this movie was okay but far from great and probably will not watch it again unlike some other scifi movies including the aforementioned 2001 a space odyssey.,7
2022.11.15,10,i find myself watching this film atleast once a year since it came out and every time im blown away by it. i used to be a huge movie junkie watching atleast 2 movies every single day but as my life has gotten busier ive migrated over to youtube the home of short attention spans. nowadays i maybe watch 2 or 3 movies a month and rarely watch something ive seen before but this here is the kind of movie that deserves a rewatch and another and another. if youve never seen this which would be weird since it came out almost 9 years ago then you are in for a treat granted it will be a bit of a depressing treat but a treat none the less.,4
2014.12.24,7,interstellar is an interesting thoughtful science fiction film with a good cast. it depicts a near future where an environmental disaster has sent earth into an irreversible decline forcing humanity to seek a new home in another galaxy. although it is not as good as christopher nolans other work it still rises above most other blockbuster high budget scifi. a number of factors make interstellar better than average. first of all it avoids the clichd film apocalypse with lots of cgi explosions and a central villain. in this movie the world dies not with a bang but a whimper as our food crops gradually die out. it also gives interesting consideration to the social effects of such a catastrophe. more importantly it treats the audience as at least somewhat intelligent. although im certain neil degrasse tyson could pick it apart on twitter if he so desired the film attempts to be somewhat scientifically plausible incorporating relativity theory and even a mathematical equation as major plot points. its disturbingly rare for movies in recent years to aim at an intelligence level above that of a thirteen year old. the film also benefits from good designs of its space ships and robots. the robots deserve particular mention. rather than the typical humanoid looking designs the filmmakers created a genuinely original even plausible robot. the main weak point in the film is that it tries to insert too optimistic an ending when the story really wasnt building to one. nevertheless it is well worth watching.,15
2015.03.21,1,its not a science fiction movie  its  um i really dont know how to classify it other than its full of itself. ive watched every science fiction showmovie out there and if youre like me you will be mad after watching this movie. you can make a movie if your premise is right for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a chance at making a half decent science fiction movie. you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible. well winterstellar they dont even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence. if you like star trekany of them tv spin offs or movies star wars babylon 5 battle star doctor whoold or new and even 2001 space odysseyboring but well made considering when it was made take my advice and stay away you will loose 3hrs of your life. the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no sense.,7
2024.04.09,10,one of the best movies ever. i dont know whether i talk about the visuals the music the plot the passion the love the drama the losses or the wins. lots of things happened and lots of things felt. the father daughter thing  the belief the well to live the love the desperation the tough decisions and just so much is there to feel. i feel like if i lived another live. i really cant believe that i have waited ten years to watch the movie. but i am so happy i did that. because in one of my hardest times i found something to get me out of there and to take me to a better place. amazing work!,9
2024.05.02,9,the story is set in a nearfuture earth on the brink of environmental collapse. matthew mcconaughey stars as cooper a former astronaut turned farmer who embarks on a daring mission through a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable planet for humanitys survival. as he traverses the vastness of space cooper grapples with the challenges of relativity the mysteries of the universe and the sacrifices required to ensure the future of humanity. christopher nolans direction is masterful seamlessly blending grand spectacle with intimate character moments. the films visual effects are aweinspiring depicting the wonders of space and celestial bodies in breathtaking detail. nolans meticulous attention to scientific accuracy and his ability to balance complex concepts with emotional storytelling create a truly immersive experience. matthew mcconaughey delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as cooper capturing the characters determination vulnerability and deep connection to his family. the supporting cast including anne hathaway jessica chastain and michael caine bring depth and authenticity to their respective roles enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. interstellar is a film that transcends the boundaries of traditional science fiction. while it explores mindbending concepts such as time dilation and the nature of black holes it also delves into universal themes of love sacrifice and the enduring human spirit. the screenplay cowritten by christopher nolan and his brother jonathan nolan strikes a delicate balance between intellectual exploration and heartfelt storytelling. the films technical aspects are nothing short of extraordinary. hoyte van hoytemas cinematography captures the vastness of space and the desolation of earth with stunning visual compositions. hans zimmers score with its haunting organ arrangements and emotional crescendos heightens the films dramatic impact and adds another layer of depth to the storytelling. interstellar is a cinematic experience that challenges the mind and stirs the heart. it invites audiences to ponder existential questions about the nature of time the possibilities of space exploration and the profound connections that bind us together. the films blend of scientific exploration breathtaking visuals and emotional storytelling creates an unforgettable journey that resonates long after the credits roll. in conclusion interstellar is a mindbending and emotionally resonant scifi epic that showcases christopher nolans visionary storytelling. with its compelling performances stunning visuals and thoughtprovoking narrative the film stands as a testament to the power of cinema to inspire and provoke contemplation. interstellar is a mustwatch for science fiction enthusiasts and anyone seeking a transcendent cinematic experience that explores the vastness of the universe and the depths of the human spirit.,20
2017.02.17,9,a great science fiction movie with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. no one can deny nolans talent all his movies are well made and interstellar is one of his best works. some people say that the plot of interstellar is confusing but i dont think so maybe because ive watched this movie more than 20 times. still we can say that its a bit confusing if youre watching it for the first time but dont worry it wont be confusing after the second or the third watch. something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space there is no sound simply because of the vacuum. in many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion gun fireetc in space which makes it look less realistic. but in interstellar every single thing is physically correct because nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic. interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. it shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind. interstellar is an amazing movie and its definitely worth watching.,10
2022.11.27,10,the best film in the history of cinema. the film makes you think about the meaning of life about people close to you. the movie that will make you cry at the end of the story. if you have kids you will love them even more after watching this movie. christopher nolan has created a film that will be the benchmark for every scifi director and it probably wont get any better. interstellar should have received every award that could be given. i never liked films of this genre. i chose it by accident and i do not regret that i looked. the film goes on for a very long time but it passes like a moment.,9
2019.09.12,10,i have watched this film 3 times. each time i discover something new. not only about the story itself  but it also taught me alot about me and my life. if you watch this film  you will learn a alot abot our earth solar system other planets and other galaxies. watch this  the cast is amazing the visual effects and the music the music makes me wanna work for nasa. nolan is a real deal,6
2020.05.22,10,this movie is a masterpiece a pure example of art and how good a movie can be. i am typing this review at 145 am during lockdown. yeah i just watched it in 2020 somehow missed this beauty in 2014 but well this movie is way way ahead of its time for the year 2020 as well. it felt really great to watch this.,4
2014.11.22,7,as a scifi fan i looked forward to see this. the earth in peril is not a new idea and much of the film is derivative. 2001 and contact come to mind. the acting is soso. and the cgi is nothing special. it is also far too long which i do not mind if the film has the scope to need it. this one does not. anne hathaway what is all the fuss about. mathew is a fine actor indeed one i did not like when first i saw him. the journey through the wormhole was better done in contact. and how come an ice cloud would not fall? the planets they reach are dull. water without a sign of life. a frozen planet is not a place humans would like to settle. then half way through i was completely baffled. spoiler alert. why did matt damons character rebel? perhaps a revisit when on tv will clarify.,18
2024.05.02,10,christopher nolans interstellar is a breathtaking journey through the cosmos blending dazzling visuals mindbending concepts and emotional depth into a cinematic experience unlike any other. from its stunning depiction of space travel to its exploration of profound themes this film captivates audiences from start to finish. at the heart of interstellar is its gripping story which follows a team of astronauts on a daring mission to find a new home for humanity as earth faces environmental collapse. led by the brilliant matthew mcconaughey as cooper the crew ventures into the depths of space encountering breathtaking wonders and unfathomable dangers along the way. nolans direction is nothing short of visionary seamlessly weaving together elements of science fiction drama and even philosophical speculation. his meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame from the meticulously researched depiction of black holes and wormholes to the hauntingly beautiful landscapes of distant planets. but what truly sets interstellar apart is its emotional resonance. amidst the cosmic spectacle the film explores themes of love sacrifice and the bonds that connect us across space and time. the relationship between cooper and his daughter murph played with remarkable depth by jessica chastain and mackenzie foy forms the emotional core of the story grounding the film in human experience amidst the vastness of the universe. of course interstellar is also a technical marvel with groundbreaking visual effects that bring its otherworldly settings to life with breathtaking realism. hans zimmers haunting score further elevates the film heightening the tension and emotion of each scene with its powerful orchestration. while some viewers may find interstellars ambitious narrative and complex themes challenging to follow those who are willing to engage with its ideas will be rewarded with a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. in the end interstellar is more than just a movie its a profound meditation on the human spirit and our place in the universea cosmic odyssey that transcends space and time.,13
2017.05.27,6,whoever the genius was that cast matthew mcconaughey as a super intelligent astronaut completely funked up what otherwise would have been a highly rated scifi drama. sorry but brilliant scientific observations and explanations just dont sound credible coming from a typecast smooth talking ladys man sporting a redneck accent. its awkward and i just couldnt get past it. russell crowe george clooney... anyone but matthew mcconaughey and this might have risen to the level of great.,5
2014.11.07,4,attention there might be spoilers here but otherwise it is just not possible to discuss the film imho. so do not read further if you have not seen it yet. actually it is the first nolan film i see and i am openmouthed at the huge hype preceding it. the film does not fulfill the expectations in most ways. the worst is the insufferable dialogue which forces good actors into ineptness matt damon being a particularly sad example. the whole screenplay needed about twenty thousand revisions more. there are characters that are completely superfluous so much that one gets killed without any repercussions in the plot at all. and they do not seem to have a use for the character romilly either except getting older. the idea of the nasa chief being a villain is preposterous why send people on a mission you know they are going to fail? and his own daughter? since it is all secret which gallery would he be playing to? and mind you caine is one of the very very few convincing characters the other ones being ellen burstyin and the robots. there are huge scientific errors too in spite of kip thorne. to slow time so much in the water planet the gravity would have to crush the astronauts in essentially the first instant. a solution would have been to have the planet or the ship move nearer the speed of light but apparently nobody thought of that. points are about as subtle as a kick in the stomach and i fail to see why anybody would think the science is dense and the film is complex. special effects are good. of course but not as much as the hype says. and sorry if you get near a black hole you would be thinned out like spaghetti by the enormous gravity. it is just impossible not only to survive but to get out. the they is just a deus ex machina to save the main plot from its own inepcy and since this is all supposed to be so scientific their appearance in the plot is completely arbitrary and illogical. and what pray would be these quantum data? since the quantic theory applies only in extremely small dimensions why go look for it in space?. somebody thought it sounded cute i guess. there was no need to be realistic and scientific if we are getting out of the mire by miracle. the ending is maybe the best part at times moving but the notion that somebody who has been in hospital and will be let out only in a couple of days can rush to a rocket and take off without space suit raining or assistance as if it was a bicycle seems ridiculous. my first and last nolan film i suspect.,27
2019.10.19,10,my favourite movie so far.everything in this movie is perfect. i think that the essential element of this masterpiece is the music. never again a music will match so well with a movie. at the end of the movie my mind was blown away and i couldnt think about anything else. thats why we love movies!,6
2020.09.09,10,i dont know how could i explain my experience.if you are a human at least oneyou should have to watch this movie.brillaiance at its peak.i dont wanna say its just a movie.interstellar is more than a movie reality.watch yourselves and think about this review thankyou,6
2024.04.24,9,i know nothing about astrophysics or cosmology and i watched this film 10 years ago i was 14. throughout the years ive lost count on how many times i have rewatched this movie. this film tackles about such a complex matter which involves knowledge about different branches of science. as a former 14yearold scifi fanatic this movie was laid out in such a way that people will understand. while science might not be everybodys thing this film touches the subject of family and survival something everyone can relate to. its a great tearjerking film that makes people question what they know about the universe and all the possibilities it offers. at some point of the film it will also make you question your morals and empathize with the characters. interstellar is a thoughtprovoking piece that i think is a mustwatch for everyone especially scifi lovers.,8
2024.05.06,10,to be honest what attracted me in this movie was the soundtrack its one of the most beautiful and amazing soundtracks ive ever heard and then i was like lets see what the movie is and thanks good i watched this everything is perfect literally everything the acting the cast the plot it was a little hard to understand the scenes were really good you can see how good are them i had mixed feelings i cried so much and i was surprised i didnt understand the plot from the first time but i did in the end that was one of the best experiences make sure that you watch this with high quality enjoyy.,1
2023.06.26,10,the tempo is slow but the cinematography acting and story are satisfying. it gives extra pleasure when watching scientifically correct. the most important part of this pleasure is the way they deal with the black hole black hole  white hole the explanation of the theory of relativity the atmosphere created by the black hole while passing through it and the theory it put forward you can hardly stand still while watching the processing of the planets and the travel to them. lastly his theory about creatures in the 4th dimension and the dramatic atmosphere that dominates the whole movie bring the movie to the top. my favorite nolan movie. you should definitely watch it.,6
2014.11.04,9,i gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because while it is not perfect because nothing is i at least thought it was perfect for the genre. i also would like to not that a vote of 9.5 is impossible for some reason and i think that is insane. people say all the time scifi is a hard genre and i disagree. the truth of the matter is space is a hard subject to make an interesting movie about. in this movie the only problem is if you have seen gravity you at least got to look at a beautiful woman on the screen for quite some time. this movie i have to be honest anne hathaway does not look her best. which makes sense because how can someone expect to look like a top model while spending so much time in space? any who i had the pleasure in seeing this movie in 70mmm imax film and let me say i highly recommend it. i wish all theaters or at least all of the people wanting to see this film could see it in 70mm. i felt like it was the way the movie was intended on being viewed. overall great movie for the fans of space.  this movie is the dream of any kid that has ever dreamed of space. my second and last tip for those who have not seen the movie yet is pay attention from the first minute to the last. you have to pay attention or you will miss something. which we should all know by now since the director is christopher nolan.,16
2018.03.10,7,interstellar is a good movie i admit. but the relativity part of the film is very fictional and metaphysical. the film is overrated and doesnt deserve 8.5 rating.,4
2014.11.13,10,this is easily one of the best movies ive seen in my life and im not that young anymore! truly epic basically this centurys 2001 crossed with gone with the wind. the first stand out thing is that it gets the physics right. the second that if you have a child you will struggle to hold back the tears at some of the themes running through the movie. the third that it manages to span generations while never loosing sight of the plot or the characters development. the fourth that after watching it you feel like youve sat through a tour de force and need a break just to process it all. to say any more would ruin the plot but wow ... just wow!,8
2017.03.13,6,one thing i learned from great movies is that they have their quality aspects proportional to each other. you imagine what you get if you have great acting and poor directing or great directing and poor story or great story and poor focus. what do we have in this movie? great acting great directing great poetry and absurd scientific claims which kills the joy of watching the movie if you are a little aware of the principles of modern physics. if you are an artist or musician or anyone who has no knowledge about quantum mechanics relativity and modern cosmology you can go and watch this movie and enjoy its great poetry. if you however have some knowledge i warn you that you may feel distrust and disappointment to the whole story and start blaming all the actors and the director for making such serious efforts while the story is scientifically absurd. i mean if the director and the rest intend to create a scifi movie they must avoid too detailed and serious explanations of how things happens in the universe with serious faces. this reflects their ignorance and spoils the poetry of the movie. i can bring few facts from the movie that is nonsense and they needed to avoid it. 1. a warm hole is a theoretical concept and in practice no one even remotely knows what it is yet. 2. you may travel through a warm hole but you cant direct yourself to a particular planet. 3. a black hole has several orders of magnitude more gravity and warmth than the sun anything falling into it burns down and becomes about the size of an atom. the protagonist would be dead long before reaching its center. 4. and all this nonsense of looking to our particular earth from the black hole just because it has different dimensionality ... i dont even want to talk about it. 5. after 30 years their children needed to think about other life related things as well and not sitting and talking about their fathers mission all the time be a bit realistic about life. 6. the biggest nonsense  after years father and daughter are meeting and just smiling and crying. this is not an american drama folks the man has been in another galaxy and see the most unnatural thing in life his daughter is 80 years old. they both should have been perplexed got panic attack feel extreme feelings collapse or something. what the hell was that? a meeting with tears and smile? to sum up the immensity of the universe and its effect on human aspect is is poorly explored. there should have been abnormal feelings going on in the move due to this but we saw none!,29
2025.09.09,2,who is the audience for this film? its too faux intellectual for people who know anything about sci fi or science even its not artistic in a 2001 vein for art film fans its got action that has zero emotional payoff or suspense things just sort of happen randomly and all the actors are picture perfect pretty people renesme from twilight and whatshisface the overrated actor with the french name whos in every film now are beyond bland and everyone speaks in dialogue so awkwardly expository it brings cringe to every scene and tableau. the tear jerk moments are so bizarre and contrived they made me angry i see how this film appeals to americans who find chipotle smothered in ranch to be the height of cuisine. this film is chipotle smothered in ranch.,4
2020.08.03,9,this is a film that deals with cliched issues like global decimation and overpopulation maybe not today but definitely in the foreseeable future. the space travel is the reason i watched the film. i had to watch this film once when it came out a second time immediately after it dropped on blu ray and streaming services and i still want to watch it a 3rd and 4th time just to experience the wonderful acting cinematography and visuals again. christopher nolan knocked out of the ballpark definitely not his greatest movie ever but yeah i can see top 5 inception and dark knight are better.,4
