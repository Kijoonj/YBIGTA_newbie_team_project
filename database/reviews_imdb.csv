2021.10.29,10,"Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant."
2019.06.26,10,After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE
2015.05.31,10,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time. Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."
2022.05.08,10,"Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's. But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing."
2016.04.13,10,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us. Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans. Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, 'we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.' For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning. The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie. Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything. I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
2015.04.08,10,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
2025.01.02,10,"I think of movies as an art form that evokes emotions in us, homo sapiens. Interstellar is one of those rare pieces of art that stirs the deepest, unexplainable feelings about what it means to be alive-aware of our temporary existence yet capable of imagining beyond time, into the infinite. Its exploration of love, sacrifice, and the unknown feels profoundly human, connecting us to something greater. The visuals are breathtaking, the score is hauntingly beautiful, and the story resonates on an emotional and philosophical level. This movie made me cry, not just for its sadness, but for its sheer, overwhelming beauty."
2021.04.06,0,"I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust..."
2015.04.06,10,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
2022.06.25,10,A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.
2014.10.29,6,"I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything. Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.  Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work.  By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to '2001: A Space Odyssey' is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in 'Interstellar' sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work."
2019.04.17,10,All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome.
2014.11.07,7,"Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a 'ghost' in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved. That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters. Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole. But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film. Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect. For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story."
2014.11.11,5,"So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do?  Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else.  Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic.  I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet?  Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence.  I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed."
2015.12.14,10,"Interstellar - Review Certain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me. Why you might ask? Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it. The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes.  ..  . Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
2018.06.24,10,"I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR.  One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
2014.11.05,10,"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie. And this is IT! When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will. First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.  These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years). Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him 'X'. His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).  Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly 'X', will managed to convince you about that. My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say 'we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick' are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
2020.08.28,10,"There is not even a single day I don't think of this movie, it's scenes , it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever."
2016.01.27,9,"Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth. This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration. Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic."
2019.10.06,10,THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT. THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. IS ANYONE HAS DOUBT?
2014.11.08,0,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
2015.05.20,6,"You would think the story is adventurous, exciting, beautiful! Its not at all what I had hoped. It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box.  The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before.  Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all.  The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have.  I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous.  I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be."
2014.11.01,10,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film. You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.  Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.  I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured. Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves 'behind' us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the 'black hole beyond the horizon' * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, 'all it takes is a little push ! ' *you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out. Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
2014.11.13,6,"Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep. The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose.  'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight. The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction.  Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years."
2014.11.07,5,"I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it. Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this.... Set your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here...."
2023.01.14,10,"It's difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I'd go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you've experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn't a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful. This is a sci-fi film in which the 'fi' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity. I would be lying if I said I wasn't highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn't very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you're watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn't a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke. I will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet."
2015.01.25,9,"A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival. Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors. This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a 'Hathaway hater' like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in 'Wild'. This may be the greatest ever film about physics."
2014.11.03,9,"(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style) There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit. Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film. Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece. This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
2022.12.26,10,"The fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of NASA pilots, who travel through a work hole in search of a new home. I've only watched it for the second time, the first being when it first arrived on the big screen. My opinion hasn't altered since the viewing, it's an epic masterpiece, the story holds up remarkably well, but the acting and visuals all contribute to make this film something very special. The story is remarkably good, it's cohesive, well balanced, it makes sense. Matthew McConaughey's best film role still for me, he's awesome as the lead character, superbly supported by both Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, it really is a well made epic. The visuals, the special effects are all tremendous, and have held up as the years have gone past, it remains one of the most incredibly beautiful visual films of all time. Epic 10/10."
2014.11.25,10,"Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. 'Inception' director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza 'Interstellar,' toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, 'Interstellar' doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored 'Guardians of the Galaxy' aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the 'Star Wars' and 'Hunger Games' franchises. Instead, the 'Interstellar' scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, 'Interstellar' qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as '2001.' The casts of 'Interstellar' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while 'Interstellar' boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen '2001: A Space Odyssey,' you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen '2001' will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious '2001' references in 'Interstellar' are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie.  'Interstellar' occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of 'Mud'), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of 'Worse Friends'), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of 'The Conjuring') who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of 'Terms of Endearment'), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like 'Paranormal Activity.' Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of 'Batman Begins'), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of 'Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of 'The Hunger Games'); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of 'Interstellar' will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind!  'Interstellar' is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout 'Interstellar.' The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout 'Interstellar.' Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, 'Interstellar' amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending."
2014.11.05,10,"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the 'fi' part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
2014.11.24,0,"I understand Mr. Nolan purposely made the dialogue in Interstellar indistinct to achieve some artistic goal. Unfortunately, I, being almost completely deaf, could not understand enough dialogue to even guess what was going on. I can usually get by without close captioning, but in this case, it was impossible. If I had known this going in, I would have opted for a theater with close captioning . . . whoops, this wasn't digital. Sarcasm aside, I guess Mr. Nolan did not think about how his decisions impacted the hearing impaired. I did not vote because it would not be fair to judge the book solely by its cover. I need to see the movie again with closed captioning before I can vote. I hope I didn't spoil this for anyone. Mr Nolan sure spoiled it for me."
2014.11.11,6,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys.  Where to start? The overtly obvious and cliché ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The 'dramatic' content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do.  Some cliché shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The 'beings' (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece. 'Human nature' is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes.  The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie. Music is great too, though sometimes overused, but it's Hans Zimmer for crying out loud. What I enjoyed was the layout of the dystopic future, perhaps a little emphasis on how the world came to be that way would have made for a better and more plausible movie(don't even get me started on the absurd physics of this movie. good luck running from a black-hole). Simply put, this film is by no means a 9, and it simply doesn't qualify for the top250 (though of course there are many titles there which don't qualify even for the top875384)."
2022.07.06,10,"This movie is no doubt the best I've ever scene this movie gives you everything emotions,love,hype,excitement,etc.. In my opinion this is the best movie made by Christopher nolan. The ending is so good that I had to watch it twice I loved this movie so much and tbh I don't think any movie will Top this one for me ."
2015.08.29,6,"This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, 'Interstellar' is above 'Casablanca', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Psycho', 'Apocalypse Now', and 'CITIZEN KANE'! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than 'Citizen Kane', which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time! Is is better than 'Citizen Kane'? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is 'The Dark Knight', which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. 'Interstellar' is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out. The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how 'love conquers all' seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences. Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!"
2014.11.19,4,"If you saw 'sunshine' and thought 'wow, good thing they had scientist advisers, this stuff is so plausible', you will like 'interstellar'. If you saw 'armaggeddon' and thought 'what an awesome movie, i just wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his daughter out even more', you will like 'interstellar'. If you saw 'inception' and thought 'this movie would be so much better in SPACE!', you will like 'interstellar'. And if you liked '2001' or any other intelligent/geeky sci-fi movie, you will hate 'interstellar'. Like some of Nolan's earlier works, it's long for the sake of length only. Its plot is up there with 'armaggeddon' in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of '2001' just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back. Disappointing."
2019.07.01,10,"I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. Perfection. Mind-blowing. A workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. Amazingly unbelievably awesome. This is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. Lots of amazing scenes with epic music. A killer story told flawlessly. Perfect directing by the best ever. Great cast with great acting. A deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters. The most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time. I keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling. EDIT on tenth viewing: This movie destroys me every time. Numerous tears EVERY TIME. And I don't just mean at the obvious emotional parts. There are so many moments where I am in complete awe at the beauty of the filmmaking I'm experiencing, to the point of tears. The way the story all comes together and the 'epiphany moment' is so perfect that it brings me to tears. When watching movies, I sometimes think, 'this is the best thing I've ever seen' or 'this is the coolest thing I've ever seen.' I know it's hyperbole and I've said it many times, usually at one or maybe two scenes in a movie. During Interstellar, I feel this way for about 40% of this three hour movie. Every time I watch, it re-emphasizes that it is CLEARY my favorite movie of all-time. And that musical score alone gives me goosebumps for so much of the movie. Hans is the GOAT. Nolan is the GOAT. (11 viewings, 12/2/2016, 2/26/2020, 1/11/2022, 8/9/2023, IMAX re-release 12/6/2024) SPOILERS I was randomly thinking about Interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. I thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. If plan B was what 'originally' happened and Dr. Brand survived, future people figured it out, and they want to save those they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = Cooper and Murph. Doctor Brand knows this because she knows Cooper loves Murph, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows Murph grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future people (eventually, after her death) put the machine in the same black hole that Cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. Will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, I like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory I had about the 'original' mission being completed without Cooper. Lots of awesome concepts that made me think, like Murphy's Law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. The robots are cool and original. Really awesome visuals of things I've wondered about but never really imagined. I liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughter's room. The way everything connected is very awesome. The different planets are so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. The endings are perfect. Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time is the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his son, Jesse. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother. The relationship between Coop and Murph is the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie is the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needs to save the world. From Interstellar group chat discussion: -Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work -So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people off earth. She found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste. That should break a person. Murph is a beast. -The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data. 12/2/16: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without Cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get Cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann backstabbed humanity. But it actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmund's planet which was the right one. In that 'original' timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet."
2015.05.03,10,"The ones that you still think of weeks even months later. The ones that make you think and leave you breathless. The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours. I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far. Bravo Nolan what a great human bean"
2014.11.04,10,"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space...  New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured.  I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.  Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of 'Endurance' starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself. The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in 'Interstellar' impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere. The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the 'Space Odyssey' and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar. Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: 'Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children', deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.  Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The 'Endurance' itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's 'Odyssey', and they are pleasing to the eye. Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life.  'Interstellar' is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.  'Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.'"
2023.03.13,10,"The key of this movie may feel like you're watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can't find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan. Mixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan's projects are a bit dangerous and special. Not only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great! Brilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer. The film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time. The Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming. The VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is. Some of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It's not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector. The main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It's mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true. But you can't make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even 'Based on A True Story' movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can't name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what's going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can't ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect."

2014.11.04,9,"So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take: To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good. Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before. For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time. Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop. One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released. After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown. Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."
2025.08.20,0,"I don't even know where to begin with Interstellar. Calling it a 'movie' feels wrong it was an experience. From the first shot to the last, I sat there completely locked in, and by the end I was a wreck in the best way possible. What blew me away was how it made me feel so small and yet so connected at the same time. Space has never felt this terrifying, this beautiful, this real. One moment I was holding my breath as they spun the Endurance to dock against impossible odds, the next I was crying my eyes out watching Cooper break down as decades of his children's lives passed by in minutes. I swear that scene will stay with me forever. Matthew McConaughey absolutely destroyed me. His performance wasn't acting it felt like watching a real father torn apart by impossible choices. Every look in his eyes carried both hope and heartbreak. And Hans Zimmer's score? My chest was literally vibrating in the theater. That organ made it feel like the universe itself was speaking. What I love most is that Interstellar isn't just about space travel or saving humanity. It's about love. About time. About what it means to be human even when the odds are stacked against us. Somehow Nolan made wormholes and fifth dimensions feel as emotional as a hug between a father and daughter. By the time the credits rolled, I was sitting there in silence, completely drained and overwhelmed. It's rare to watch something that makes you feel both so tiny in the face of the cosmos and yet so deeply grateful to be alive, to love, to be loved. For me, Interstellar isn't a film I just 'watched.' It's something I felt. And I'll carry that with me for the rest of my life. 10/10. Not just a masterpiece - a piece of most hearts."
2014.11.11,6,"I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in these categories. There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had something new to offer. Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie. Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger."
2023.01.19,10,"I've probably watched this movie for the 10th time and wanted to watch it with my mum this time. Every time I cry in this movie. I'm 31 years old and I fall for it everytime. Probably one of the most beautiful movies ive ever seen in my life. Mathew and anne put on the performances of their lives while engaging the audience at every corner in the movie. 3 hours is a long time for a movie to run for yet by the end of the credits your yearning for more and wishing it wasn't ending. This still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Special, enthralling, epic and just perfect in every way."
2014.11.09,6,"Interesting in parts, but I aged 23 years watching it. Derivative of many other films including Contact, 2001, Forbidden Planet, Signs and most egregiously North by Northwest. Worst score in recent memory. Also, some of the special effects are pretty lame--all too obvious when models are being used. Gravity was much more visually arresting. Way too many close up horror expressions. The universe is supposed to be filled by interstellar gas, which must be true, given so much gassy dialog. Nolan manages to work in the Do Not Go Gently Into That Good night poem not once, but four times (look for the last time on a plague at the end."
2014.11.07,5,"SPOILER FREE BEGINS ********* I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics. Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about 'Gravity's leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an 'Inception' than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon. SPOILER FREE ENDS ******** Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the 'Aliens' or 'They' (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work ('Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills ('oh we lost so many years'). And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell. And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it 'Original'? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground. And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore. I don't think even the fanboys can save this one."
2022.12.12,10,"Have you ever wondered why there are so few good movies? Some movies have good story, some have delightful music, some have acting masterpieces and some movies have all of them together. Enjoying this movie is the easiest thing possible. Words are not the only means of expressing feelings. Life is planting the seeds of love. Life is mental water that flows. Life is not about being alive, it's about being free . I haven't seen this movie for years because I want to forget it and give me the same new and great feeling again. But alas, legend never dies. I invite you to watch this movie. The next hours will be the best hours of your life."
2014.11.04,10,"Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"
2014.11.11,10,"The most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit. They look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited. The movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. Those robots there are amazing as well, complete opposite of Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I love them. The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. Finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible. It all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the Universe encountering strangest parts of physics."
2014.11.13,10,"chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a Renascence First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronaut Matthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene  And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).  Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.'"
2014.12.25,8,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's 'Batman'-trilogy, but here is his newest work: 'Interstellar'. He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate. This is like our generation's 'Armageddon', only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. 'Interstellar' is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really. Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has 'Selma' in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year. The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always. This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot."
2014.11.08,6,"There is a lot I like about this movie. I love the overall themes of the end of mankind on this planet and trying to find a new 'home'. Everything you'd expect to work in a film of this budget does work: It looks awesome, the actors are good, the score is great etc. These things are what make this movie worthy of the prize to a ticket. While I give Nolan credit for taking on these huge themes, I don't think he quite delivers with this one. Of course with a movie like this there's gonna be plot holes and you could nitpick it to peaces and that can be enjoyable part of a movie too. The biggest problem with me was the human side of the story on the emotional elements. I do think Nolan did good job convincing us of how hight the stakes were on this mission. And I enjoyed the elements about the relevance of time and how years past in the earth while they've only experienced a couple of hours. The big human element of the story is the relationship with a father and a daughter and that just doesn't work well enough. It's almost laughable how long it takes for the daughter to forgive her dad for leaving her for the sake of mankind. Even though she works in the same facility that send her dad away in the first place. I guess it's dramatically better that she sends her first message to him when she's the same age he was when he left but it just doesn't make much sense. Also Brand's speech about love being an element that reaches over time and space is just laughable. You could do that with any other emotion and still have it make as much sense. I also found the emotional scenes to bee too manipulative. I just didn't feel for the characters as much as I should have. The scene with Cooper and old Murph was just stupid. They haven't seen in decades and have both experienced more than most people could imagine with huge emotional package. And they spend like two minutes talking to each other. And Coopers grand children and grand-grand children don't even talk to him even though he's supposed to be some kind of a legend. They just silently leave the room when he arrives. In general the movie was just overly chewed and explained. They should have left more stuff up to the interpretation of the viewer 2001's style. But I still don't regret seeing the film. It is quite an experience visually. And for that reason the stuff that doesn't work is such a shame."
2024.12.10,10,"It's difficult to put into words how breathtaking and epic this movie is. It is the greatest film I have ever seen. The blending of a close, intimate father daughter relationship with a larger than life space expedition to save humanity is executed brilliantly by Nolan and crew. The visual effects, story line, writing, acting, and scientific accuracy were all perfect in my eyes, but it's the sheer emotion of the film that gets you. Multiple scenes will have you wiping your eyes as Nolan's manipulation of time in this movie does a brilliant job of evoking never before felt emotions in the viewer. A true masterpiece of cinema."
2015.03.13,6,"I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly. That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same. First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long. The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first). Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.)  The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments.  Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.) As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others."
2014.11.07,4,"Yesterday I watched the movie 'Interstellar'. A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again."
2014.11.05,10,"(((WOW)))...!!! It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve. In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece. Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart. Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan... Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!! It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it."
2023.01.26,0,"Interstellar. You come into the film expecting a decent sci fi film and in the process , hope to know something a bit more about the void , but you come out having witnessed a grandiose yet heart warming story . The genre of the film easily comes under the banner of sci fi , but underneath the shroud of the opus and all the visual spectacle it provides ; at the core it is the story of the relationship between a Father and his Daughter which resonates with the viewer at a level which is hard to put in words. Rarely you will witness emotions pass through you as you see the credits roll for a sci fi film .How Mr. Nolan has so delicately woven a story with this level of Spectacle and feeling is a tale for the ballads . Supported by great performances from the cast ,a legendary score from Mr. Zimmer , beautiful visuals , Interstellar is a definite must watch."
2014.11.12,10,"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it. Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema. We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow' territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found. The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns. Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act. To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL). In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's 'stargate' from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous. Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't 'go quietly into the night'! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role. Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension. I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey). However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN! (If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of previous reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future notifications.

2024.07.19,10,"I mean, seriously. I am such a movie fan. I watch everything. Nothing comes close to this. This movie changed me. Interstellar is a revelation! Its themes are incredible. How love can be a quantifiable force. Love for one's children. The quest for a better life for them. The strength and courage it takes to step into the unknown. The ties that we share with our people. And if you are just a little bit of a nerd, it leaves a mark forever!... Performances are stellar. All actors are giving it their all. I am NOT a fan of Anne Hathaway, and I even loved her! Also, Zimmer's score is sheer PERFECTION. It will make you cry and ponder. BEST MOVIE EVER."
2015.04.03,9,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called 'the most scientifically accurate movie' and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece."
2014.11.08,10,"-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side. That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length.  I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt. In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms.  Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll."
2015.11.05,10,"Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor. The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth. The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself. I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen."
2023.07.06,6,"This movie requires blind faith in theoretical physics as much as religion requires blind faith. And I'm not talking mainstream blind faith - I'm talking Mormon/Scientology levels of blind faith. The best one can do is just watch it as a film, and not get caught up in the science, or lack there of. As a film, they spend WAY too much time with the family in the beginning. Time that should have been dedicated to the actual space travel. A very slow burn, but the acting is great. A serious lack of explanation for things they want you to swallow for the story to make sense. I give it a one time watch value of 7; with a rewatch value of 4. Together - a 6. Decent, but the hype around this film makes no sense; almost as much as the 'science' involved."
2019.03.01,10,One of the greatest sci fi films of all time. Christopher Nolan proves that he is a master director with every film including Interstellar.
2014.11.10,7,"'Interstellar' pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuarón's audio-visual roller coaster, 'Gravity', but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle. For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE. Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch. We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole. Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience. Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it. Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value."
2014.11.12,3,"OK, my first IMDb review. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's work and I'm a science fiction fan. Sadly within an hour I was wondering if I could stick out another two hours. The actors are all great, and they get the few stars I'm willing to give it. I will admit that directing a big production like this is not for the faint-hearted and I'll give Nolan points for that. However, the story is so poorly constructed it just piles on frustration after frustration. Other reviewers on here have described the litany of illogical errors. I haven't read all 900 reviews but we have long known that black holes EAT stars and planets, and when they do, they give off titanic bursts of gamma and x-ray radiation that would sterilize entire regions of a galaxy. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in service of just enjoying a movie, but when the entire premise is to find a more suitable home for human life and then you choose a planet apparently orbiting a black hole, well that just goes from suspension to just outright disbelief. If Batman had chosen to just use his magic freeze gun to stop the nuke in Gotham I think most Batman fans would have been groaning. That's the way someone like me feels about lazy plot devices like this.  There is also WAY too much unnecessary dialogue in this movie, the superb cast are wasted saying clichéd and hackneyed lines. The whole punchline of the 'ghost' you could see coming in the first hour, so you just ended up wondering how they would get there over the next 109 minutes. I'm sorry but I thought the music was intensely annoying and was just designed to jar you awake every half an hour. Then there is the whole 'Don't open the airlock! Don't open the airlock!' I was sitting there thinking 'Just open the damn airlock and get it over with.' Everything was either entirely predictable or completely illogical. Floating frozen clouds? Seriously? The least they could do was have Tinkerbell fly onto the set and explain how that could happen. I guess because Cameron got away with nicking Roger Dean's floating mountains in Avatar, Nolan thought no one would complain. But let's face it Avatar wasn't exactly trying to be clever and that's where this goes over the line. If you're going to delve into the BIG questions like Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and black holes you set yourself up to be measured by a whole new set of rules. Nobody complains about Harry Potter flying on a broomstick but have him try and explain it using Einstein and you're going to be in a mess of trouble. As for the reviews comparing it to 2001, the only things it has that are the same is that it is set in space and there is a wormhole. Absolutely nothing else is the same and frankly it is an insult to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece. And when people say, 'get over it, it's just a movie' they're rewarding someone for being lazy. Just like Gravity this had all the elements to be a masterpiece if they'd just bothered to talk to a few more people in the science community besides Kip Thorne; who apparently understands the workings of the universe all except for the black hole which is Hollywood."
2019.11.09,10,"During the emergency docking scene, I said to myself: 'this movie is perfect'. I couldn't fund a flaw. The story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. There is a gravity to their work and they each show it well. My favorite genre us sci fi. This is plausible scifi, which is my favorite subset of scifi. McConnahey is amazing as usual. The young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again. The music is so good I'm learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site. I've seen Interstellar 7 or 8 times. I'll watch it regularly for years to come. It's a classic of our time much like Inglorious Basterds."
2024.08.14,10,"An unmissable date for any science fiction fan. Nolan reaches limits rarely seen and is on par with Kubrick or Andrei Tarkovski in terms of his representation. Matthew McConaughey is incredible and it may be one of the few Nolan films where there are strong female characters who make themselves known. It is a visual and sound journey, because yes, the soundtrack is one of the best we can see from Hans Zimmer (and I think that says a lot). The level that Nolan reaches to get to this point is incredible, how everything is there, the scientific, it is plausible, it is credible. Although sometimes he may be arrogant and intellectual, I do not consider that he is making fun of the fans, it is all there, all the time. It convinces me from beginning to end and despite its length I would watch it a thousand times."
2022.06.29,10,"I love this dream movie so much. I have never seen a better movie than this one. A fantastic dream realized. The music was outstanding, and the acting and directing were tremendous. This fantastic film should be seen by everyone!"
2014.11.05,10,"'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars. To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced. At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver. Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through. Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive. 'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise. This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)"
2014.11.05,10,"OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies that you either love or hate. Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film. Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an 'Outer Space Film' is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others.  Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film.  The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive.  I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to 'calibrate' the experience. Which is very cool.  Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it."
2014.11.06,0,"This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet. 'Interstellar' is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity. As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures. The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy. It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed 'Interstellar' thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging."
2014.12.01,9,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."
2014.11.07,6,"'Interstellar' was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched 'Gravity' and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the 'Contact' premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up."
2014.11.09,10,"I just returned after seeing 'Interstellar' again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film.  First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic?  The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details.  The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest. This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike 'Interstellar' - it's that good. What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint."
2014.11.09,6,"I won't give it a 1 to even things up a little, I give it a 6 which is real. Maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. I'm disappointed with a film that I waited for so long, with a great title that was waisted. Interstellar should have been a masterpiece, with, well, a lot of Interstellar traveling. The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched. Interstellar has got great visuals, I give it that, but Gravity had more (another film that sucked big time). I wouldn't watch it again."
2014.11.21,2,"OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved 'Interstellar', but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making. I won't even bother with dissecting the 'science' in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make. The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost. The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior 'Contact'). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact. I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to 'A Perfect Storm' and a location less dramatic than your own back garden. I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to. So in conclusion, 'Contact' did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say. Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears."
2014.11.08,10,"What an incredible film, a mesmerizing ride from minute 1 to minute 169. I couldn't believe when it ended that it was already finished; time appeared to go away quickly when watching this in the theater and remember when it ended, I wished there was more of this epic movie. Great directing, great performances, the effects/sets could have been better (I like my detail which unfortunately some scenes/effects lacked) and you got to take a big leap of faith to ignore the obvious paradox. If you do the latter, you will enjoy a Nolan's masterpiece. One of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best sci-fi I have ever watched."
2014.11.12,10,"I have never in my life experienced such an emotional brake as I did today watching Interstellar! I left theatre shaking violently, crying and having I think 150 BPM. Every single piece of the movie from the story itself, visuals, music and acting is a perfect combination and perfection. I even can't find right word to give you proper review (partly because English is not my native)and summarization won't give the movie justice. The only thing I regret that I watched it dubbed (though in my country dubbing is really good) I advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as I did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey! P.S. Oscars to Nolan and the movie right away!"
2014.11.13,10,"the sixth sense meets inception. makes you cry, sweat, and question your own actions in the face of these scenarios, if you approach the film wholeheartedly and ready for the ride then it will take you on quite a journey, and you'll only want to see it again and again. the music really does the job of keeping you suspended, Anne Hathaway and Jessica chastain do fine work, as does Matthew McConaughey, and the little girl playing a younger Jessica Chastain pulls at your heartstrings. i was really really pleased with this and wish it was getting as much attention and praise as it deserves, i think the writing was genius and it really had my brain working hard. you walk out of the theater and everyone around you is talking about it from the sidewalk to the subway ride home, everyone, it was really funny to see."
2014.11.07,10,"A Quantum Leap in Film making. The greatest story ever told. A movie that encompasses all that is and can be Human. Interstellar bravely Transcends into the unknown throughout time and space, leaving no one behind.  My persistent craving for unwavering diligence in directing and acting has been satisfied with ample sufficiency. Very few take true pride in what they do, and most never try. But to never give up hope and to reach for the stars is how real greatness is achieved. Thank you Mr. Nolan(s), thank you 'Cooper', for creating a piece that holds such faith in mankind's will to survive, and most of all, Love. 5D 10/10"
2020.11.15,0,"Don't know about you, but this is the best movie I have ever watched..."
2015.04.19,9,"Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years."
2014.11.08,10,"Bad-ass... is the adjective which I choose to type the first word of this review. As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended. The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure. Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level. I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!"
2014.11.14,7,"Even though I'm a big fan of Christofer Nolan, I find this movie pretty boring. Respect for tackling such a complex subject and for making generally smart blockbusters. Unfortunately, movie is a big mess. Wrong pace, melodramatic acting, terrible music and mumbling i'm-a-badass-cowboy Matthew McConaughey speech just didn't work for me. One of the most miscast movies I have ever seen. I'm familiar with Solaris and 2001 Odyssey, but this one just didn't work for me. I gave it 7 after all, since I don't think movie is terrible, I just think it's not great, and people got brainwashed by marketing tools into loving this film and giving it such high grade."
2022.11.23,8,"Having destroyed all resources on the planet, like a rapacious, insatiable gannet, it's time to move on, to vacate and be gone, find a new place to rampage and beset. But where can you take all the people, to build their new churches and steeples, and how to get there, if you can find somewhere, without a breakthrough in science and maths rules. Juxtaposing a more than probabilistic forecast of things to come with the absurd, to produce a wholly engaging and imaginative piece of sci-fi that may well get you thinking of what might just happen to the planet and the people of it when the help and support of as yet undiscovered dimensions fails to materialise. Great performances, great effects, leaves you wanting to revisit 2001: A Space Odyssey but you know you'll never know why."
2014.11.08,6,"The movie is incredibly beautiful but it is not intelligent but is mostly a strange mix that does not quite know what it wants. I like it when science and technology are described believable which at times is the case here, but just as in the masterpiece in 2001, it falls hard when you mix in philosophy with a high level of abstraction. Of course there are more holes in the script than can be listed here. One obvious to me is that if the descendants of humanity are those that make us survive Who was it that saved us the first time? We meet several parallel stories and my 14 year old daughter even shed a tear over something she could not quite explain afterwards. We meet the stories about how humans devastated the earth's resources, technophobia and heroes immortality. The only person who seems quite realistic, however, Matt Daemon. It's like his mixture of malice, selfishness and cowardice doing so the movie gets off the ground for a short while. And it is of course not good for a film largely set in space (pun intended)."
2014.11.06,4,"Interstellar is mediocre. The story is chock full of cheap clichés ('Love is the 5th dimension!'), over-layered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained. The movie makes sense until Matt Damon. Up to that point, the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up, more or less. Although If you know you're going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet, why leave that one poor guy on his own? It's kind of heartless and that's when I started doubting the movie. But OK, fine. I can live with that. Then they head for the ice planet. And, all of a sudden, 'gravity is the force that transcends time' and 'your mind fights death so you can see your children'. All downhill from there, way into deep space 9. The movie takes a turn for the worse: A nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. It's endearing, but incomprehensible. Granted, the movie's pretty. So I gave it two stars. The actors? Love all of them. That's another 2. But I simply cannot live with a script that's nonsensical and full of stuff we're supposed to take at face-value, because it's Christopher Nolan, and he's an otherwise brilliant director: What was Michael Caine trying to not solve? What is all the research about? And, sci-fi directors: Please, drop the blackboard and chalk cliché. We technology people use computers now. Blackboards were useful when Newton was running things. Now? Not so much. It sounded like (but I'm not really sure) the five dimension bookcase, which lost me completely, was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. But then I also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. Then, why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? Why not just send an email with the data component that's missing? Why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? And how is that future humanity saved anyway? And: How does the robot, whose location in space is never explained, come in possession of that data? And do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? Going back to the Michael Caine thing: What's the precious data component that he was missing? What does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? (sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones). And how does humanity get saved? Do they invent some sort of galactic Noah's ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that Earth has become? Could they not do that before? I'm sure they could. How does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? Or maybe that's not what happened. I'm just not sure.  The list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodge-podge of pseudo-philosophical-pseudo-scientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. It's intended for (1) sci-fi dorks who tend to not over-think things (2) Nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny (3) movie 'buffs' who enjoyed Cloud Atlas, which was more boring and more bizarre than Interstellar, but only slightly."
2025.04.18,8,"I don't watch movies very often, I'm not a film critic and I don't really know much about movies. But I liked this movie. I had the opportunity to watch it earlier at an earlier age, at that time it seemed that it's an ordinary movie. Now that I've watched it again, I realize that it's not a movie. It's a masterpiece. I won't talk about the plot, I'll just insist that you watch it. Thank you for your attention. I still need to write 150 characters to publish so the score will go from 90 to 0 90, 89, 88, 87, 86, 85, 84, 83, 82, 81, 80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0."
2024.12.14,10,"Interstellar is and always was one of my personal favorite films of all time. I first experienced the film in IMAX when it was released in 2014, and I've been a devoted admirer ever since. But this week, I was fortunate enough to be in New York precisely when the film was being re-screened in IMAX - and not just any IMAX, but in the grandeur of IMAX 70mm - as part of the 10th-anniversary celebrations of its release. Despite having seen the film several times before, rewatching it multiple times to mark its decade-long impact, in the magnificent IMAX theaters of the U. S., stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences we've had in our lives. No matter how many times I watch the film, it always excites me, intrigues me, and also brings me to tears. A unique cinematic experience like no other, that pushes the boundaries of cinema and how science can be depicted in film. The collaborative process between Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (known for Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, and Westworld, among other works) in crafting the screenplay united two brilliant but slightly different minds. This dynamic provided the creative friction that birthed such an extraordinary story. In the early stages, Jonathan was the principal screenwriter, entrusted with the task of shaping the script. He worked on the project for several years alongside producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. The original draft was heavily centered on the intricate scientific principles underpinning the plot, such as Einstein's theory of relativity and, in particular, the concept of time dilation. When Christopher came on board as director, he reworked the script to emphasize the emotional and philosophical dimensions of the story. This shift - from a strict focus on science to one that balanced scientific rigor with emotional storytelling - became one of the defining aspects that granted the film its unparalleled strength. It is, ultimately, this synthesis of emotional depth with scientific exploration that elevates Interstellar to a truly extraordinary work within the sci-fi genre. The scriptwriting process between the brothers included a continuous exchange of ideas at every stage of its development. Christopher's inclination toward emotional storytelling intertwined with Jonathan's passion for scientific precision and narrative complexity. As the film's director, Christopher also had the responsibility of translating Jonathan's abstract scientific concepts into compelling, visually stunning cinematic moments and images. This process enabled audiences to grasp abstract and extremely complicated scientific ideas through groundbreaking visual storytelling. It's incredible to witness how, with the passage of time, Interstellar is increasingly recognized not only as a monumental chapter in Nolan's legendary filmography but also as a bona fide classic in the sci-fi genre. With the Nolans now receiving the broader recognition they deserve from the global film and television community (not just their core fanbase), more and more people now grasp the thematic essence the Nolans were striving for with the unique storytelling elements they insisted on including in Interstellar. One of the most unique characteristics of Nolan as a filmmaker is his profound love and respect for science, as well as his understanding of its importance in both storytelling and real-world impact. This is reflected in the themes he chooses to explore, the logical framework behind his scripts, and the technical aspects of his filmmaking process. From project to project, he constantly experiments with new techniques that push the boundaries of film industry technology. He strives to maintain scientific accuracy in his narratives as much as possible while telling captivating stories that highlight the vital role of scientists and the value of intellect in the modern era. Contrary to the common criticism that Nolan's films often sideline female characters, Interstellar features a significant and very welcome representation of strong, influential women in the field of science. Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway deliver compelling and charismatic performances, taking center stage in the film's unfolding events and playing a crucial role in the story's progression. Mackenzie Foy also impresses in a once-in-a-lifetime performance of a curious, intelligent, and ambitious child that doesn't shy from the performances of other veteran actors and actresses in the film, with a role that will surely inspire future generations of young viewers. If we delve further into the unique collaborations behind the making of Interstellar, and to the film's unique property of depicting science in the most accurate way possible, the extraordinary partnership between Christopher Nolan and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne stands out as one of the film's most intriguing aspects. This collaboration was paradigm-shifting in its own right, as it sought to depict Einstein's theory of relativity as accurately as possible on screen. Instead of resorting to clichés or convenient narrative shortcuts, Thorne, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, acted as both scientific consultant and producer of the film. His primary role was to ensure that depictions of black holes, wormholes, and the effects of relativity on time dilation were as scientifically accurate as possible. Maintaining scientific precision required a delicate balance between creative cinematic storytelling and the constraints of established physics. While Nolan, known for his narrative complexity and visual ambition, occasionally sought to introduce elements that bent the rules of physics, Thorne firmly insisted on absolute scientific accuracy. This principle of realism shaped not only the depiction of time dilation but also the emotional and philosophical core of the film, where time itself becomes a central, emotionally charged narrative device. Their collaboration continues to set a gold standard for how science can be faithfully integrated into cinematic storytelling. After watching the film in an IMAX theater in the U. S. this week, I noticed a group of young students from a school or some sort of academic club attending the screening. They even took a group photo afterward to commemorate the experience. If that doesn't highlight Nolan's influence in inspiring future generations of innovators and scientists, we don't know what does. Of course, no discussion of Interstellar would be complete without mentioning Hans Zimmer's phenomenal score, which the legendary composer himself has referred to as his most cherished soundtrack in his extensive career. The process of collaboration between Zimmer and Nolan was unconventional and experimental compared to their previous collaborations. Instead of supplying Zimmer with a script or a detailed plot outline, Nolan wrote him a one-page letter describing the film's central emotional core - the relationship between a father and his daughter - and asked him to compose from that emotional premise alone. Without knowing that it was a sci-fi epic, Zimmer crafted an intimate and deeply moving score built around a church organ, capturing the emotional anchor of the story. This approach yielded a score that felt personal and evocative, rather than tethered to the spectacle typically associated with the sci-fi genre. The two also chose to emphasized the use of a church organ to evoke a sense of cosmic awe and spiritual transcendence. Ultimately, the focus on emotional authenticity, rather than bombastic spectacle, produced a soundtrack that has become one of Zimmer's most celebrated works, earning critical acclaim and nominations for the Academy Award and the Grammy. In a typical fashion to Zimmer's groundbreaking works, Interstellar did not initially receive the recognition it deserved from major award bodies like the Oscars or the Golden Globes. But history tends to favor the enduring, and today the Interstellar soundtrack is regarded as one of the most powerful and timeless film scores ever created. The raw emotional resonance it evokes during the film, and even while listening to it completely outside of watching the film, is nothing short of extraordinary. Even generally speaking, looking back at the awards season following the film's release, the Academy's reluctance to recognize Interstellar and Nolan's achievements while creating the film remains truly baffling. Nolan did not receive nominations for Best Director or Best Original Screenplay, decisions that now seem glaringly questionable in hindsight. Particularly when compared to certain contemporaneous winners, like Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, which Interstellar, in comparison, stands head and shoulders above in ambition, visual storytelling, and philosophical depth in our opinion. With Nolan's triumphant sweep during awards season for Oppenheimer, one can only hope that the Academy will, in the future, be more open to recognizing his contributions to the Sci-Fi genre, which has long been overlooked at such ceremonies. What might have been an open question 10 years ago is now clear: Interstellar has cemented its place in the annals of cinematic history as one of the greatest and most important Science Fiction films of all time. Its scientific precision, gripping narrative, breathtaking visuals, extraordinary performances, masterful soundtrack, and impeccable execution on all fronts have earned it a rightful place as one of the most iconic films to ever grace the silver screen. And above all, it's a whole lot of fun."
2024.12.13,10,"This has been one of my favorite movies ever since it was released in 2014. I've watched it countless times and Nolan is by far my favorite director, but I had never seen any of his films, besides Oppenheimer, in IMAX... until last night. I was fortunate to catch the 10 year anniversary showing of Interstellar in IMAX and was absolutely blown away. The fact that I was on the edge of my seat for a movie I know so much about is a testament to how powerful this movie is. The score is the best in any film and the space visuals are simply stunning. The film flew by and I left the theatre with my mind blown, even more than I could have anticipated. I plan to always see this movie whenever it is shown and truly believe everyone needs to experience it the way Nolan intended. 1000/10... simply the greatest film I've ever seen on screen."
2023.07.08,8,"I haven't seen the film since it came out in 2014. My teenage self found it slow, confusing, and tiresome. But, now I'm 2023, I decided to give it a rewatch solely because I constantly listen to the score. So, what did I think? I am pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the film. The film has so much heart for a SCFI movie that it took me off guard. At its core, it's about a Father wanting to reunite/protect his Child. The story was interesting, the ending might've been a bit too optimistic and rushed but it felt satisfying to me as a viewer. The cinematography, music, acting, sound design, set dressing, everything was amazing. Yes, there were points where I was thankful I had subtitles on. Seeing Topher Grace was also a bit odd since only associating him with That 70's Show and Venom. The visuals for the space scenes were astonishing. Truly a feat of CGI and Technological advances. Overall, there are more positives than negatives for the film. It was a great watch, the emotional beats landed for me, the betrayals were impactful, and it left me thinking more about this potential scenario."
2025.10.27,10,A total masterpiece from the beginning to the end. So clever so educative so good acting I don't think I ve ever watched a better movie in my life. It's from the movies that sticks in your mind and change your way of thinking. I don't have to say anything negative about it. A 3 hour movie that you can not take your eyes off of it.
2024.12.11,10,"The best movie of its decade. Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's finest film to date. Interstellar is ambitious and riveting from start to finish, a film that never fails to grasp your attention during its three-hour run time. With dazzling visuals and a gooey yet strong emotional core that's truly affecting, it's one of the best movies I've seen all year. Interstellar is a science fiction film that explores the themes of love, sacrifice, and humanity's place in the universe. The film follows a former NASA pilot who is recruited to pilot a dangerous mission through a newly discovered wormhole in search of habitable planets for humanity to colonize."
2014.12.13,0,"Science fiction fans don't need everything spelling out for them. That's why the narration was removed from Blade Runner. That's why 2001: A Space Odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes. That's why R2D2 doesn't speak English. There's a scene in Interstellar in which Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face. This blunt method of explaining Murphy's Law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which Interstellar's running time is so bloated by. It is also the first of many inferior echoes of Contact. In Contact, James Woods explains Occam's Razor in a similar fashion, however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place. More significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from Contact in which Jodie Foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father. Jessica Chastain's character here does likewise, only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that it's hard to sympathise with her. The other female character in 'Interstellar' (yeah there's only two) also spends all her screen time pining after a man. Feminists - stay away! Another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to Event Horizon. This is when one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is. Which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is. It wouldn't happen, like, ever. At least when Sam Neil gave the low down on wormholes in Event Horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was, once again, justified by context. Perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is TARS, a computer with delusions of being the next HAL 9000, which is actually nothing more than metallic origami. Have I mentioned it knows a joke? Yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times. The joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage. Why watch this when you can watch Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running? Why go for Christopher Nolan's take on Dust Bowl migration when you can read John Steinbeck's instead? On a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at. You know, like the cool graphics in The Hobbit or Transformers."
2015.11.03,7,"Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it.  It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it.  And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie."
2024.12.09,10,"Interstellar (2014), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a visually stunning and emotionally charged sci-fi epic. The film explores love, sacrifice, and humanity's quest for survival as a group of astronauts travel through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. With breathtaking visuals, a hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, and strong performances, particularly from Matthew McConaughey, the film blends science and emotion. While some plot elements may feel complex, its ambition and thematic depth make it a thought-provoking cinematic experience. Overall, the one thing missing about this movie is that it doesn't have part 2."
2014.11.20,6,"A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum."
2015.04.20,3,"A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love."
2014.11.08,10,"Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, 'Interstellar'. I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an 'event'. For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception. It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of 'Interstellar' because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come. McConaughey has always had that 'movie star' potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. 'Interstellar' was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jaws', puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in 'Close Encounters' or Roy Schneider in 'Jaws'. They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be. The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like 'Gravity' last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for 'the science isn't accurate'. Those comments are nonsense because no matter what 'science' tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of 'what can be'. It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like 'Interstellar' In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds. People will remember 'Interstellar' for either being a truly great film experience or 'not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey'. This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to '2001' and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as 'Interstellar' come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility. In the end, 'Interstellar' is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it."
2023.01.12,10,"Before I watch this movie I knew that it was very high rated, also i've seen some spoilers and I thought it wouldn't be good as I expected, but when I saw I forget everything, it was just amazing, it was the perfect combination of visual effects, incredible music, story and unforgettable performance, i love this movie, it's just a masterpiece. 'We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements.' Thanks to christopher nolan."
2022.07.04,10,"Just an outstanding performance by Matthew and just a great directing Job. The Film Story is out of this world an if you love The universe like I do, it´s the perfect movie for you."
2021.11.18,10,"Incredible story full of emotion with suspense and great acting...I watched this movie more than 5 time and it's the best SF movie i 've ever seen! 'It's not possible'. 'No, it's necessary'."
2022.12.11,10,"I watched this when it first came out and I recently just re watched it, it never gets old. Best movie out there. Nothing is better than your first time watching this movie because it will blow you mind. One is the reasons this movie is loved so much is because of the highly scientific accuracy, I honestly cannot express how amazing this movie is and how beloved it is to me. The movie is completely mind boggling and I love it so much. Everything was great, the plot was 10/10, pacing was 8.9/10, cinematography was 11/10, acting was 10/10 so overall 10/10. Definitely recommend, and your movie standards will definitely change after watching!"
2023.04.22,10,"I watched this movie for the first time when i was twelve and I have to say, very very few (maybe none) movies can even be compared to Interstellar. Its not just a sci-fi movie, its an experience, an emotion. It stays with you, it lingers, it gets into your head and heart and takes over your consciousness. Its a masterpiece. You will not be the same after you finish watching this. The visuals, the acting, the story, the soundtrack...everything about this movie is exemplary. It's been 9 years, and this movie never fails to amaze me and I keep coming back to watch it again and again and again. Quite possibly the best movie ever created."
2020.09.07,0,"Going against the grain, yet again. Am I the only one that was extremely distracted by plot holes, an inexplicable 'love will save the day' ending, and Matthew McConaughey's fake tan? Alright so Matthew McConaughey is an ex spaceship pilot, stumbles upon NASA cuz, you guys, the government is evil now, is recruited for a mission to save the planet by finding another planet to colonize. Plan A is to evacuate Earth and move to that planet. That plan (SPOILERS!) is a sham. The real plan is Plan B, which is to repopulate the new planet with embryos. So is Anne Hathaway going to give birth to a hundred babies? How exactly is that going to work? They save Matt Damon. He turns out to be evil and loyal to Plan B. Sets about his own doom by ignoring all warning signs that his airlock is not secure (seriously?!). Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey set sail for another planet. But Matthew McConaughey goes rogue and gets sucked into a black hole. The power of love transports him to his daughter's bedroom (?) - but IN THE PAST YOU GUYS, and he sends messages with Morse Code. Apparently transferring all of the data he's learned about...something or another...through Morse Code (that's one heck of a compression scheme), which allows his daughter to save humanity. He then gets saved from the black hole (?). Reunites with daughter on Saturn (?). And sets up the premise for the sequel. The plot isn't so much twisting and turning as it is just convulsing and flatlining. I didn't really care about any of the characters - actually Matt Damon was the most interesting. The film takes literally an hour to get to space (just c'mon already!). And by the point that the The Power of Love intervenes, I was just sitting in my chair quietly laughing. Gravity was way better. === Directed by: Christopher Nolan Written by: Jonathan Nolan, Christopher Nolan SUMMARY Crop failure threatens the existential survival of humans on Earth, so an astronaut is tasked with going with a team to explore other planets to colonize. The mission goes horribly wrong - including not enough resources, extreme time dilation, a lying and villainous member - and ends with the astronaut going into a black hole and giving his estranged daughter the answer to fix the crop failures. RATING S Watched this again the other day and what a ride. I don't think I really appreciated this the first time I saw it when I was younger, but ten years later, it hits a lot harder. I still feel the plot is a little wobbly at times - including the ending, which felt a little too nicely wrapped up - but overall the storytelling is fantastic and, in terms of a space movie, promises and delivers everything - including going into a black hole."
2014.11.07,7,"Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas. The movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. 'We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars,' he says, 'now we just look at the ground and see dirt.' Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy. Despite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver.  It's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship 'Endurance'. Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land. In addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real. When the plot does finally introduce a 'villain' in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax. Interstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all. Nolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction. Grade: A+"
2023.11.07,10,"For a Sci-FI geek and a problem solving brain, 'Love' does not count for much in your average day by day. But, boy oh boy this one hits you in the feels you didn't know you had. This move is like an Eminem song. It has everything. Love for fame, for science, for your fellow humans, for mother, father and children, for your dead ones, for the unborned ones. You name it. This move reconciles the working class with the intelectual/elite class and puts them in the same level of importance. I have never seen a portrayal of this so balanced. It's the first exploration of the universe as a physical 'need' and not as a 'curiosity'. This movie has so many nuances and perspectives that a narrow mind like mine cannot explain them accurately. I'll stop here. Just watch it."
2014.11.07,6,"Let me bring you this in overview.  PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing.  CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here. All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely. But with an expectation that it's not as special as we've come to expect from Nolan."
2014.12.05,3,"'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the vacuous pretension one would expect if a Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with an implausible adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins inauspiciously and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the Hollywoodian elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, baseball, dust storms, a dying Earth, paranormal activity, cornfields - and lots of corn. After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an interstellar wormhole, the far-fetched nature of the tale expands to cosmic levels. Nolan's need to overwhelm his audience with awesomeness is so powerful that he forgets to tell a believable story. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, frozen planets, deranged scientists, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-level climax. The visual effects are above average, but diminished by the cheesy melodrama of the narrative. When all the film's 'Sturm und Drang' has died away, self-importance and mawkishness are the abiding impressions."
2022.05.25,10,"The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes."
2014.11.10,10,"I saw this opening night (Thursday). I wanted the full monty. That means IMAX (I drove across town to get it). Wow! There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG! I loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. For me at least, it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. This is a science fiction film for the ages!"
2014.11.13,10,"Expect very much from the cast and director. And all expectations fulfilled. The film is almost 3 hours, but they are not feeling. Time flies by. No slack in the story-line. Everywhere where there might be desired drool, snot or lengthy disquisitions - all collected in a couple of phrases and capacious video sequences. Nor any stupid nonsense about the Bible and God. It's Sci-Fi, baby! After viewing the impression left is not even like the movie, and how soundly from the book that you read with pleasure. Lots of thoughts left to think. The film, like a good book revealed to you something new, along with the author allowed to dive into his world. World, so close to ours. Very suggest targeting the film for viewing. Even if you do not like everything in the movie, you will get acquainted with one of the best representatives of the genre on today date."
2024.08.16,10,"I just rewatched Interstellar, and I can confidently say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The storyline is spot-on, and the visuals are absolutely mesmerizing. Every time I hear Hans Zimmer's 'Interstellar' theme, it hits me right in the feels. The twists and theories in the movie are so thought-provoking, they really make you ponder how the universe works. It's one of those films that sticks with you long after the credits roll. I think many of us can agree that Interstellar is a true masterpiece. I hope we'll be lucky enough to experience another masterpiece like this in the future. Movies like Interstellar is rare, it sure leave a lasting impression. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it-I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
2024.05.14,10,Interstellar is an amazing movie all around. The casting is good. Matthew McConaughey was amazingly well in this movie. (Really his performance showed what his career has worked up to be. Astonishing.) I also would like to point out that the sound of being in space felt real life. The sound of nothing. The sound of movement with hydrogen and helium. (Space 'air') The different emotions I felt watching this movie was mind blowing. This movie had my attention the whole 2h 49m I believe this is truly a 10 out of 10 movie. I feel that watching this movie has gave me a new perspective on how much work is put into movies. Everyone must watch. Interstellar a work of art. AL.
2024.08.15,10,"I rewatched this movie after 10 years... initially seeing it in the cinemas when it released, i realise i was too immature to watch it back then. After a decade i finally decided to watch this again. I cried my eyes out. A fully grown man crying like a child watching this, thank god nobody was here to witness. I truly managed to grasp the beauty and emotion of this masterpiece after so long. I dont think i need to say much more, i just wanted to write something after wiping all my tears. I wish i could go back in time to that moment, as i am now and relive that experience of watching it all over again. Exquisite. Emotive. Exceptional."
2014.11.14,0,"Some Spoilers: This turkey is so bad, that I would almost demand my money back. For a movie that takes itself way too seriously, there are more holes in the plot than you can count. Scenes go on way too long, this movie should have been cut in half and it would not have lost anything. The dialogue is stilted, Anne Hathaway is the Queen of over-acting, the music is too loud and very little of the story line makes any logical sense. The ending is just downright silly for a movie that pretends to take the subject of quantum mechanics seriously. And then right smack in the middle of the movie it introduces Matt Damon, then halfway through his time on the screen his character does a 180 degree flip and then BAM, he is bumped off. The only redeeming quality of this movie is a really cool robot and a scene of a time/space dimension that is really well done. Other than that, I would be hard pressed to give this movie a 2 out of 10. Perhaps 1.5 would be more accurate."
2014.11.05,7,"Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10."
2014.11.12,10,"This film is just legendary, I do not see why people are hating this film, its unpredictable and well just plain brilliant. A lot of the science in this movie is true (for a science fiction film). I believe this is Nolan's best yet and I believe that its probably the greatest film ever made. Matthew deserves an Oscar for his role (no joke) and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right (completely new and different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception). The FX are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. The acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose. So overall to conclude this film is just MINDBLOWING!"
2014.11.13,6,"There are moments during 'Interstellar' which may be compared to '2001: A Space Odyssey' (a better movie). There are moments during 'Interstellar' which may be compared to 'Prometheus' (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within 'Interstellar' that are completely ripped off from 'Inception' (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, 'Interstellar' should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date. This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world. OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of 'Interstellar' (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the 'gravity' of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2. Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of 'Interstellar', for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see 'Interstellar' for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up."
2014.11.11,5,"Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that. Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this. Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same."
2014.11.12,9,"INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!"
2014.11.04,9,"Went to see the film Wednesday evening. Overall it was an enjoyable film from start to finish with the help of humor along the way. Excellent casting, descent visuals, and a good sound score. There were times I felt the music was overkill and would drown out certain scenes but overall well done. Story meshed real well too and threw in a few curve balls. I would have liked to see some better visuals from space. Especially when they arrived in the new solar system. Been cool to have seen unique planets of different colors orbiting each other for instance. Something unique to stamp the distance and uniqueness from our system. Trivial but it's those small things :)"
2014.11.05,8,"This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors. First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are 'they' out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath. I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive. It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced 'the message' of the movie. But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions. I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness. Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly. Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now."
2014.11.13,10,"'Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day.' that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #INTERSTELLAR even though it was inspired from a poem.  Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future. Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember 'do not go gentle into that good movie'. #INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever seen in this decade. Take a bow Chris Nolan and 'orgoglioso DI es sere UN fan DI Christopher Nolan''"
2014.11.07,10,"As a sci-fi fan, who loves 2001 SO, Contact, Gravity and many other movies that deal with with the topics also covered in Interstellar, I have to say, I have no words to describe the movie. It just took me for one hell of a ride! The score provided by Hans Zimmer was an extraordinary piece of work. It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around. There is an interview with Christopher Nolan, in which he states that he wouldn't allow Hans Zimmer to know exactly what the movie's plot device is, he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between father and daughter. If this is the truth - WOW! it worked flawlessly! I won't go and describe what I saw on the big screen because this is something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for himself... I can only tell you that after I saw the credits, I attempted to get off my seat, it didn't worked. I tried again, pushing harder - it barely worked. Moments after I was at the theater's exit heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me, but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes. Then I realized that I have also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... I was still in the movie, I must definitely been, because only there the time behaved the way I was feeling while coming home..."
2014.11.12,10,"I went to watch this film, not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about. It started off well, although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space. This does not effect the film though or my rating one bit, as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary! The special effects in this film are awesome, and are used in a way which I was literally at the edge of my seat, in shear anticipation, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. Its very tense in many parts, and it certainly keeps you thinking. I don't know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star, or say 'disappointing', 'rubbish' 'stick to batman, Nolan'! These people don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! Its a brilliant film, something suitable for all the family! Definitely a film for everyone, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!"
2015.01.14,0,"The film outright fails for me, because it's about all the vital stuff in life, love, loss and new discovery as each one nested in the capacity of our minds for vision. But Nolan is a logician, a geometer who has to know everything in his narrative world in advance before he can construct it. So he doesn't get any of it in an intuitive way, an allusive way, a fluid way for appearances to suggest things. He cites Zerkalo as influence, next of course to 2001, a masterwork with an elusive logic, not wholly tractable, not complete, not causal, a spontaneous capacity for images and connections between them. But he does the opposite, 2001, something tractable, complete, causal, not spontaneous. Logical. (Cool tidbit. One of the great discoveries of the past century is a limit in formal logic that implies there's more that is true than provable in a given system, something that every aware creative person knows intuitively, axiomatically to be true. I like to think this is why Malick abandoned philosophy for the cinema, proof for expression. Flipped around it means that if you stick to what is strictly provable within your narrative you must miss out on some expressible truth.) This logic screams at me in one particular strand of plot, the ghostlike presence in the girl's bedroom, at first mysterious, but it's actually Nolan's way of creating the explanation of what he's going to do inside the black hole, which is his way of creating the metaphor about love as a powerful force. How? An actual force that transcends spacetime! (Btw, all that fuss about a renowned physicist assisting the production and they go ahead and film all that black hole stuff?) In other words the only way he can create metaphor is by having it be a plot device, so that the profundity of what happens to us must be accompanied by its narrative explanation; it only succeeds in reducing the intuitions we have (about love, connectedness etc).  What's left is Nolan's own journey in space towards images that expand understanding. This would be his most ambitious so far. Does he do anything interesting? The Dustbowl interviews show he wanted a more grounded approach, a good idea to start among cornfields. Better action than before. But still unimaginative. A big indication for me was the scene after Coop wakes up from cryosleep and checks his messages from Earth; an entire life has gone by, and among all the possible images that Nolan could have put there to evoke that life, in a time when so much of our vision is mobile and we carry with us cameras everywhere (even more so in that near future), he gives us static monologues before a desk. The same teary tone. What a tragedy of inexpression!  The mind at play here is like the spectral Coop trapped in that boxed space behind bookshelves and able to see only loops. Nolan gambled here of course, tried to elevate himself to more than contraptions; failed. It turns out he can only roar about that night which great filmmakers gently recall without explaining. Why this man is held in high esteem in a medium that should celebrate visual ability while a modern calligrapher like Shunji Iwai is an unknown says it."
2014.11.10,7,"As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!). Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result. For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!! And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired). If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie. 7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should."
2014.11.08,9,"Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program. Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp. No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!"
2014.11.08,6,"Got to watch it on in IMAX format last night and found the IMAX experience disappointing, still trying to understand if the effort to shoot in 70mm was worth it. Same low def, blurry type of delivery as watching Gravity on a plane. Mentioned Gravity at the outset, as it comes to mind more often while watching Interstellar than Kubrick's 2001, I guess not what Nolan brothers were shooting for... So, a 2nd display of spinning debris in the cosmic emptiness in 12 months, while trying to make this cinematically thrilling and engaging denotes some sort of gumption, not that Hollywood haven't seen that kind of FX sequeling so many times. Let's say that making movies in 2014 about stuff in space is not easy, in a space where sound waves don't travel and silent movies are long extinct for a reason. Interstellar however is not a very quiet movie at all, lot of vibrating spacecraft and gripping soundtrack as fillers. Kubrick got that right back in 68 using the Blue Danube to keep us connected to the scenes that everyone ever since used as textbook on any extraterrestrial imagery. Nolan is telling a very simple story in a not very precise and confident rendering, adding several disjointed mini-stories in the main one, and ending it with the grand reunion of all characters that have not died explicitly on screen after 2 and a half hours and basically telling the world that time travel is possible and it will be soon available at a farm near you. I will be brief on my rating of the main cast: Matt McCon is looking more and more like Peter Newman in the 70s and getting pretty good, followed by Jess Chastain with solid delivery, the rest are a mess: Anne Hathaway is 3/10 and Matt Damon, boy ... what happened to him ? Michael Caine is OK, but no cigar. The plot is pretty shabby when looked from above (pun intended)and the mini new age anecdotes are kept in check until the last half hour when we are subjected to full blown loss of control over what/when/how/where.. anything goes, keep calm and wait until everyone's standing up. Wait for the video."
2014.11.14,5,"I am baffled by the near universal praise this movie is receiving here on IMDb.  Out of 2 hours and 49 minutes:  about a half hour was spent watching people crying - every star got their turn;  about a half hour was spent watching people docking spacecraft with their joysticks under great duress. Really? With that AI robot thingie we can't automate the docking? And what oh what does docking add to the story?  about another half hour was spent watching Matt Damon in a dead-end downer subplot; and then another half hour was spent watching cornfields burning in the distance - why? Just, why? So right there we could cut the movie down to about an hour, and we will only have about 40 minutes left to go. Leaving maybe 10 minutes or so that were visually interesting... moderately. There were no visual breakthroughs of any kind in this movie - zip. And listen, I am a lifetime sci-fi fan. So the movie had a wormhole, and some time distortion. Please, is that in itself enough to satisfy anybody who cares about this stuff or do you maybe have to elaborate and get creative? There was simply nothing of unusual intelligence or quality in this movie. Not the writing, not the acting, not the directing, not the visuals. In the large theatre where I saw this with hundreds of people, one person starting clapping at the end. And the crowd laughed. If you're a Christopher Nolan fanboy, then by all means go and enjoy yourself and give it a ten. If that's not you, spend the time doing your taxes or something, you will thank me."
2015.04.13,9,"I found Intestellar a beautiful movie to watch and be enthralled by. After countless low grade science fiction movies parading across the screen over the decades, this one will stay with me.  The viewer should watch it for story and not for the science - the cinematography is beautiful without being flashy; the acting is brilliant and musical score works perfectly with the story. I was engrossed by the movie from start to finish, held there by the humanity and feeling portrayed by the director and the actors. Why people feel the need to compare Intestellar to Kubrick's 2001 is puzzling - this is a completely different movie and one that, when I think back to watching 2001, is infinitely more watchable. Why people feel the need to pile in rate the movie '1' is beyond me and, at the time of this writing 570,000 people had averaged the rating out to 8.7 - so, don't listen to the hate, just watch it and enjoy."
2020.11.14,10,"Everything about it was brilliant; FX/cinematography/score/sound/acting/story, and the enjoyable snippets of humour throughout Shocklingly good & by far the best sci-fi movie to exist In my top 5 movies for sure!"
2019.12.08,10,"This is first time ever that i claped to a movie, and i mean EVER. This is just incredible. There's no other movie as close. It could easily be the best I've ever seen. Just wow...."
2018.05.12,10,"'Interstellar (2014)' is a space-epic that feels remarkably intimate and emotionally resonant while also being sweeping in scope and visually stunning. The mixture of earthy textures and sleek sci-fi aesthetics makes for an interesting visual juxtaposition between the two sets of characters. While its third act does get a little existential and abstract, the narrative reasoning behind it and scientific integrity leading up to it allows for constant believability. This film never fails to have an impact on me, it is truly breathtaking work. In fact, it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 10/10"
2019.10.05,10,One of the best movies i have ever seen in my life!
2014.11.14,10,"Interstellar, Another feather in Nolan's cap, This movie is surely one of the Nolan's finest blend, it had everything that makes you glued to the seats and those nail biting moments I can watch it again and have the same feeling as watching it for the first time, and don't be fooled by some idiots claiming that the movie is way too technical and you need to brush up your Physics before watching the movie, don't fall for this bullshit, the movie is clear and concise and well not to mention but just like any other Nolan movie this one also leaves much to your interpretation and I believe that's what makes the movies of Nolan stand out from others, it's all about IMAGINATION with a good bit of science and what could very well be a reality, I don't want to spoil it for you by revealing any interesting parts of the movie, I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves watching fiction movies that makes you believe in the fiction they portray, yes we are far from the reality, but when you are in there watching this movie, those 3 hours you become a part of the movie and it becomes the reality, few movies have given me such experience in the past, and this one definitely tops the chart!"
2019.10.05,0,This film gave a fresh new experience of a space flick.
2014.11.08,6,"The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed 'overkill' of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts.  I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion."
2015.03.28,10,"The movie deserves more than 1 Oscar. I was looking at people's reviews and i was SHOCKED. how can a Great Movie have so much different impact on its watchers!! Interstellar is a movie that makes you fall in love with it. the sound tracks, the score, the emotions, the Love, every second of the movie is great. though the movie couldn't be this great without the sound tracks made by Hans Zimmer. most of the work done for the movie was real, the Nolan's style. The most obvious thing that you'll notice when watching the movie is the fact that none of the things would have happened if LOVE hadn't existed. Matthew Mcconaughey's act was marvelous. the emotions make you cry multiple times throughout the movie even if you're watching it for 101st time. Interstellar was really more SCI- than FI, that's why it's so much different and better than any other outer-space movies.  The Interstellar doesn't deserve less than 7 out of 10 if you wanna rate it."
2014.11.04,6,"How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised. By imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time. Since his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space. Another hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years. Yet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel. Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that 'we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt'. Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper. Similarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them."
2015.01.21,3,"Science Fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction. Starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation – constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. Then, we are supposed to believe that a drone – one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power 'an entire farm.' After that, Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan (Screenplay) expect us to believe that a retired NASA pilot, who never left Earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft, is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. Okay, I'll admit this one is possible, but not likely. The first planet they decide to visit – the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation – the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour, (one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot – not detected by the spacecraft instruments, by the way) is a prime candidate for colonization. Then, when the next huge wave arrives, Christopher Nolan (Director) makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds (plenty of time to get in the spacecraft) watching the wave approach and is washed away. Why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! Nonsensical! The next thing the Nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a one-way mission suddenly goes crazy, becomes a coward, falsifies data, and turns into a murderer! Were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! Don't think so! Later, this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. I guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!"
2015.04.09,9,"I know that Interstellar is a sci-fi movie, not just that, but it's also based on theories made by scientist Kip Thorne, actually that's what makes this movie special to many people. Also, the movie shows the most accurate simulation of wormholes and black holes. But the real reason why people feel touched by this movie is the emotions represented by the Cooper-Murph relationship, Brand-Edmunds relationship and Dr.Mann's courage turned into cowardliness. All of these complicated emotions are the foundation of this movie. People may forget all about relativity, wormholes and black holes, but they will never forget the touchy moments through the movie when their tears silently came out. When I compare Interstellar with Inception, I find that the idea of Inception is more original and more creative, while the emotions in Interstellar are far more effective. Both are masterpieces from the great filmmaker, Christopher Nolan, whom I thank for all of his original and unforgettable movies."
2014.11.08,10,"If there was ever a movie that impressed me this much it would be Kubricks '2001. Space odyssey' and Scotts 'Blade Runner'... This one tops both... Those who respect both of above mentioned films and directors will know what I'm talking about Everything is in it's place here: the direction, the storytelling, the musical score, the acting, the seriousness and grandness of it all, even the little humor breaks are quality beyond doubt Emotive drama dialogs and sequences are so well placed and paced, not feeling pathetic but on the contrary so much thought provoking... Nolan has made his lifetime masterpiece"
2014.11.05,10,"I believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science fact/fiction part of it. With this movie, Christopher Nolan tried to answer some questions that science is yet to. The transition form fact to fiction was seamless. Even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate, they are simply beautiful - visually and emotionally. As far as the story goes, I could care less as the stunning visuals and great background score more than makes up for it.  For those who are not fully satisfied with the story, I can understand, could be because of a very high bar set by Christopher Nolan himself. However, Don't let it hold you back if you like Nolan's movies. If you're gonna watch it, watch it in IMAX. ﻿"
2014.11.12,10,"I watched this movie last week and honesty, after the ending credits, I couldn't talk like before. I couldn't think like I used to be. My head was exploding...It was the second time my head hurts like this (First time was Memento). You will not believe this movie's greatness and amazing work unless you know it's Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. What makes it even more amazing is all you see is really built and they're not green screen or anything. It's his specialty to make classic amazing movies. This one is the best movie of his entire works. You can feel every second... I will not say more...Just go and watch it...also don't forget to listen carefully as well. Sounds and musics are phenomenal. Go and watch it... Now..."
2021.06.06,10,"I wish I could listen to my favorite song for the first time again. I wish I could do that. And this is the film. This is it. The one film I wish I could watch for the first time again... So much more than sci-fi. So much more! Thank you to the creators, thank you for this experience. I am humbled by your talent. Just wow."
2014.11.15,8,"Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story. I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if your name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises. Case in point - 'Interstellar'. Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate. Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt. It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were 'That was a piece of excrement', only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture."
2014.11.22,6,"Honestly, I was expecting more from Christopher Nolan. The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style. The biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it. It also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all. That being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual. The cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances. Alas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one."
2020.08.17,10,"I was speechless when I finished this film, the story, acting and visuals just seem to good to be true. For a film with such a big scale, it does a great job establishing the world and characters, it can be a lot to take in bit there is just so much emotional payoff that it makes it worth sitting through 3 Hours of film. I won't spoil anything, but the ending is just perfect. It makes you want more from the film but in a way that doesn't make it unsatisfying. I really have no complaints, it does everything it sets out to do, it is a real shame this didn't win any Oscars."
2014.12.04,6,"First, I like all works of Christopher Nolan. Even Insomnia. But this movie... When I first heard about it, I was very happy, I couldn't wait to see it. I was sure, that I will do it in Imax, because it deserves the best available! Two days ago finally, with two friends I watched it. None of us was satisfied with the result. My friend was really angry, He was joking, that we should ask our money back. I don't felt so wrong, but: The movie was way too long, very, very loud (maybe it was only a local issue, but sometimes music was so loud, that I couldn't understand what actors told). Story was more or less OK (less...) quite predictable. Science part was below my expectations. We saw lot of similarities with 2001: Space Odyssey, but that movie is a timeless classic. This one I think I'll forget soon"
2014.11.08,5,"DISCLAIMER: I'm in general, a huge Nolan fan. There are times when you can ignore plot holes in films, and times when you can't. You can overlook some when the pacing is fast, or when the film doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, Interstellar does neither - it's unnecessarily slow and takes itself really, really seriously. And it's full of plot holes, fallacies, paradoxes, and logic taking a beating in general, to fulfill some emotional quotient - which, I must say, worked on most people. Let's start with the whole premise the film is based on - in the future, earth's resources have been drained, and everyone has turned into farmers - with conscious efforts to eradicate science education in general to force people to go into farming. Let's take a moment here to realize just how ridiculous that premise is. Moving on - our protagonist is a genius NASA astronaut/engineer turned farmer (because, y'know, everyone's a farmer) - and the first half mostly shows him bonding with his family, with completely unnecessary scenes to prolong the film - like taking down a lost drone (by pointing things towards it), which had no relation to the story later whatsoever. Then our hero stumbles onto a NASA facility (if you aren't a farmer, you're with NASA) after decoding things which occurred due to... uhh, gravitational anomalies. This NASA facility, as claimed by uberscientist Michael Caine, was humanity's best kept secret, though 5 minutes into that - all our hero's family members were informed about it.  So anyways, since our hero stumbled into the facility anyway, uberscientist decides to send him into space to save humanity because, well, just like that. We get to see our hero saying goodbye to his family and immediate fast forward - he's in space! No training, no nothing! Economic storytelling, certainly, and it would've worked, had the other 'scientists' on board later didn't have to explain things and plans to him on the fly (which, for all intents and purposes, should've been explained before leaving) - and having conversations that were mostly like what college freshmen studying physics would have. (Oh, and discussions about love! Love transcending all dimensions - when humanity is at stake!) Anyway, so future earth has the technology to do all this, and build robot A.I.s which were more human than most humans, but it doesn't have doctors any more, or any other visible technological advancements for that matter. All efforts to save humanity were concentrated on ONE and just ONE uberscientist, who'd been working on his cure-all formula for years. And every other scientist have just been waiting for him to solve it all himself! (And what's this? Other nations you ask? Well there ain't no other nation apart from the USA to do earth saving, is there?) This is something I particularly take offense to, scientists don't work that way. So, Nolan throws more science at us on the fly, which everyone dodges. But in the end, everything is explained by, yep, five dimensional space! Somehow our hero gets into such a space, goes back in time (opening up a ton of paradoxes), behind a bookshelf in 5D space, and uses vague messages to communicate with his daughter back in time, instead of giving clear messages like 'I'm your father back in time'. His daughter, when all grown up - suddenly realizes that it was his father all along and we get no clue as to how she got to that conclusion - but hey, PLOT TWIST! And with that new information, she becomes the new uberscientist, saving everyone. How? By making an orbiting space station around Saturn (for which you somehow required 'quantum data' from other galaxies and black holes?). So okay uhh... it's complicated. There are however, some great visuals (3D would've done justice) and soundtrack in this, and hence the 5 - but ultimately nothing we haven't seen before. Beyond all that glitter, there's no gold - just a forgettable movie."
2019.02.28,10,"Soundtrack is amazing Realistic, 2001-ish space happenings Story without potholes It is a fantastic movie! No other way to say it. The soundtrack fits the scenes, scenes that are well writen, acted in a natural manner filling a story that just makes sense."
2015.04.16,8,"As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story. The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy. In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied. Rating: 8/10"
2014.11.10,10,"One of the best sci-fi movies.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater. Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him 'X'. His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say 'we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick' are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade. Just go for it, without a second thought."
2014.11.12,10,"I bought a big Popcorn, didn't eat because it was making noise , I bought a big Coca Cola , didn't drink it, Because didn't want to go to make Pee, I breath from my open mouth , because I had cold and didn't want to be disturb by that, This is my first review of a Great Movie,From my above words ,one can really understand how excited I was during this space Epic of Nolan and a great Contagious and poisonous soundtrack of Hans Zimmer , this movie made me forget about everything I had in my mind for almost 3 hours and at the End of the movie I was getting upset that this is going to be soon over and I just don't want it,  from beginning to the End , This Journey was full of excitement and surprises , this movie was like few other movies where you really don't know through every frames of movie , what you will find out next ,  i am fan of every Nolan's work and i also expected a lot from this Movie but coming out of the Movie i felt like not to mention anything about it and just to go back and sit in the middle to experience again  Many thanks to Nolan and Zimmer."
2014.11.06,10,"The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi).  From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings. As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win. Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars.  Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered. Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the 'Breaking Dawn' films and 'The Conjuring'. Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after 'Zero Dark Thirty' and 'Mama.'. Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up. In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story. From 'Memento', then 'The Prestige' to 'Inception', Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. 'Interstellar' joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10."
2022.01.13,10,"Greatest of all time. You should definitely watch this movie. If you haven't watched it, you are missing out on a lot. A masterpiece with its music and fiction."
2022.08.04,0,"After watching Interstellar for the second time it jumped 20 places on my all-time favorite movies from 20th to 1st. I don't know why Matthew McConaughey didn't win another Oscar for his absolute amazing performance; the guy really gives his all when he's on camera. The story isn't your typical, perfunctory alien/space movie but instead centers around how the current generation has the power to make or break the future depending on how they utilize their resources and how some humans tend to be so selfish when hard times come (dialogue at 28 minutes). Moreover, it really is the first movie that really explained the four dimensions of space and time to me in utterly breathtaking fashion. Nolan really managed to make astronomy interesting again and in a world where education is becoming undervalued, inspires us to grow and learn. The movie is filled to the brim with dialogues and lessons that everyone can learn from and understand. Hans Zimmer delivered possibly the greatest ever soundtrack of all time (goosebumps!) to complement the beautiful CGI and remarkable storytelling. Interstellar isn't a movie, its an experience. Unfortunately I cannot give it more than 10 stars because it absolutely does deserve higher."
2021.07.02,7,"Pro's: Actually no sound in space finally, very well done. Atmosphere of the desolate and loneliness have been captured perfectly. Big fan of the soundtracks Overall good acting, only the protagonist didn't fit too well for me Nice idea and story. Con's: Predictability. The ghost and the meeting at the end with a very old murphy were both pretty obvious to come 2/3 into the movie. Also how the heck did the dad get out of the black hole."
2022.05.20,10,"Incredible music, some of the best actors in the world and visuals that got oscars. The soundtrack of this movie has a fanbase of its own and McConaughey plays the role of an argumentative pilot perfectly. Best movie ever made."
2014.11.11,7,"9.1 at IMDb? Seriously?? 4 of my 5 stars are for the visual effects. 1 star is for McConaugh and Hathaway. The Nolan brothers, however, get zilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and quasi-philosophy. It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much 'science' into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why '2001' will remain a masterpiece and why 'Interstellar' will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real..."
2014.11.24,3,"I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about."
2023.11.02,10,"Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the realms of space exploration, human survival, and the unbreakable bonds of love. With its breathtaking visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, the film takes audiences on a journey that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intimate connections between a father and his daughter. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is dying, the narrative follows a group of astronauts, led by the former pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), as they embark on a perilous mission through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity. The film beautifully juxtaposes the vast, cold expanse of space with the warmth of human emotions, making it a deeply moving experience. The scientific concepts, including black holes, time dilation, and the theory of relativity, are intricately woven into the plot, making 'Interstellar' not just a visual spectacle but also a thought-provoking exploration of the mysteries of the universe. While some may argue that the film takes certain liberties with scientific accuracy, it's essential to remember that at its core, 'Interstellar' is a work of fiction meant to entertain, inspire, and provoke thought. The performances are top-notch, with McConaughey delivering one of his career-best roles. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine also shine in their respective roles, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. However, what truly sets 'Interstellar' apart is its emotional depth. The film's exploration of love, sacrifice, and the passage of time resonates deeply, making it a tear-jerker for many. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy and later by Jessica Chastain) is the beating heart of the story, and their emotional reunion is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history. In conclusion, 'Interstellar' is a grand, ambitious, and emotionally charged film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and filmmaking. It's a testament to Nolan's genius that he can craft a narrative that is both epic in scale and deeply personal in emotion. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges, entertains, and moves the soul."
2019.04.30,10,"I have watched this movie 3 years ago , since then I couldn't stop thinking about it . I'm a huge Nolan fan and this movie was the finest work that he ever did... The duality between Nolan and Hans zimmer took it highest level of perfection in Interstellar. I have never seen anything like this... I would recommend you to see this masterpiece as soon as you can even if you love sci-fi or no."
2022.11.26,10,"The story, script, acting, directing, editing, photography, casting, climax, and non stop questioning of our faith whatever that may be in every dimension...and doing all of this with one of the most original, beautiful and contextual scores ever produced. No other production gets close and not sure if it will ever get close; and I truly hope it will one day for future generations...as a father, as a son, as a brother, as a husband, as an avid reader and 'forever want to learn more' student of science, art, politics, history, philosophy, and finally as a man of faith...despite the fact the movie and its premises are speculative; due to its beautiful message about 'love transcending time and space' I think about Interstellar in some shape or form, EVERY DAY... PS: ScreenPrism (search on the web) is a good place to learn more about Interstellar...in search of more logical explanations between what we know today and unknown..."
2024.08.09,10,"I don't really think this movie will ever be surpassed in my movie rankings. It has the most stunning visuals of any film I have seen. The acting is incredible across the board. I cry every time I watch it. The story is very compelling and unique for a 'world ending' movie. The musical score by Hans Zimmer is perhaps the most beautiful thing my ears have been blessed to hear. This film just gives me a certain unmatched feeling of awe and wonder. This film alone makes Christopher Nolan my favorite director. I recommend this movie to everyone that is on this earth. It's a must watch. Oh and, it has Matthew McConaughey, by the way."
2024.08.10,10,"After watching this film over 5 times. Most recently just now, I cried. I don't really know why, but I did. Maybe it's just how I'm feeling today, but it made me weep. I have to admit, I saw it when it was first released and I liked it, but I have since compared it to my other Science Fiction favourites, such as Gravity and Arrival - the latter being my favourite Science Fiction film of all time. But, Christopher Nolan sees the art of film making from a totally different perspective, this film being a vehicle for his masterful imagination. I finally get it. This film makes me feel so small, yet connected to everything. The cinematography, the score, the acting is incredible. I will rewatch again and again, when I feel I the need to ground myself and realise how incredible and fragile life is."
2022.08.15,10,"After watching it, I found myself crying. I can't describe the feeling. It was an amazing experience. My sci-fi fan friends and I have watched it over and over again a million times."
2015.12.03,0,"We just watched INTERSTELLAR, an incredibly well written movie with an excellent cast. It does not surprise us that it didn't even get mentioned for academy awards. Usually the award winning movies are pretty common and filled with outlandish special effects to make bad story appealing. Interstellar has realistic special effects, a futuristic plot and an excellent cast.  'Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.'"
2014.11.12,6,"I went into this movie knowing little about it, no plot details, or even whether christopher nolan was director or just a producer. I have enjoyed nolans previous movies, but i don't care who is behind the camera aslong as the film is serving it's purpose which is to entertain. So half an hour goes by, the tone is set. There is a crisis with the crops,earth is running out of food, a lot of dust, no explanation for any of it, just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..he's an ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. Struggling to stay awake. Okay so the next act things pick up, we have loud launch into space, I'm awake again. Then silence, after all that's whats space is like y'know. Can now hear people munching popcorn. Too quiet. Oh look huge water planet, vast and empty much like this film so far. Huge wave comes.Ah some entertainment at last, clunky robot runs around... then Matt damon ! the last act, blackholes and then there is an semi interesting twist to earlier events. This was a frustrating film, had a lot of potential with the story but on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesn't get there. It starts and stalls. Did anyone really care about the characters? i certainly didn't invest. Obviously some people love it with the scores on here but i cannot agree. This is not a masterpiece in sci-fi by any means. There are comparisons to 2001 but don't even go there.I actually looked at my watch towards the end of the film to see how long I'd been trapped in this cinematic black hole."
2023.09.18,10,"I wish I could erase it from my memory and watch it again. This movie made me love movies and series. I rewatched it until I forgot how many times I rewatched it. Full of feelings, adventure, and that great music that can never be forgotten. He took us to a wonderful space as if we were with them, a great movie that will not leave my memory until I die. There will never be a movie on the same level as this movie. It breaks the laws of space-time and remains wonderful no matter how many times you watch it again or how much time passes through it. Thank you, Christopher Nolen. Thank you, Matthew. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this work."
2015.07.25,6,"I am fine with giving it 6 stars for entertainment value. But I am wondering why so many people think this is a great movie!? The movie is far too sentimental, clichéd and not-conforming-to-known-laws-of-physics of the known universe, to earn the status of a 'great' movie. When I say not-conforming-to-known-laws-of-physics, I am not necessarily referring to the worm-holes or time travel. I am referring to simple things like driving a truck with a flat tire through the corn fields. All in all, I like the premise this movie is built upon. Although I have put the spoiler alert in my review, I will still try not to spoil is too much and just say that 'them' is nothing but future 'us' is a fascinating concept. And the moral messages in the movie are pretty standard, and I am OK with that too. However, one thing bothers me. I have watched most of the top 100 movies in IMDb and I generally agree with those ratings. The current rating for this movie is not doing justice for other top movies in IMDb. All I am saying it that this does not belong in the first 100. I hope that 'anomaly in the gravity' (pun intended) will be fixed over the time."
2014.11.17,3,"Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it! I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed. First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the 'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour. The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film. The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes. At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch something like that and like it... I appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's not for me."
2024.03.19,10,"Interstellar is mind blowing to say the least! Emotional family bond, survival of the human race, plot twists, inter-dimensional time and space travel with insane sci-fi theories and gorgeous scenery. Betrayal with an incredible cast and legendary director Christopher Nolan delivers one of the greatest movies of all time. This is a movie everyone must see and appreciate. Earth's population and its human inhabitants must find an alternate planet to survive. A wormhole was discovered near Saturn that contains hope for the human race. Time is relative and a ghost from the future communicates through a dimension unknown to present day Earth. Will the human race become ghosts as Earth loses its ability to sustain life? Interstellar ... Enjoy the ride!"
2023.10.29,10,"Interstellar is a visually stunning film with some of the most impressive special effects ever seen in a science fiction film. The film's depiction of space and black holes is both awe-inspiring and scientifically accurate. Nolan also does a masterful job of creating a sense of scale and scope, making the audience feel like they are on the journey with the astronauts. In addition to its visual effects, Interstellar is also a deeply emotional film. The story explores themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and the human spirit. The film's performances are also excellent, with McConaughey and Hathaway giving particularly standout performances."
2019.03.11,9,"A fiction on facts, how our existence is driven.. An amazing storyline to define time, dimensions and how mathematics makes our survival. Its a story for our next generation to harp on. Cheers to the makers. Must watch !!"
2022.12.12,10,"This movie is brilliant. For the first time I am writing a review of a movie. This movie makes me feel like I am watching a new film every time I re watch it. The visuals, story, direction, music... Everything is so good. We will get what we expect by seeing a scifi movie. Its not just a scifi, its more than that. A Family, mystery, scifi, drama, thriller. Some scenes,some visuals which we will never forger. A Christopher Nolan masterclass. Maybe many great movies will come later in sci-fi genre, but the benchmark Nolan set is tougher to break. The science is also accurate. I dont know why I got so much fond of this movie. Just watch and enjoy the endless space and limitless emotions."
2023.09.18,8,"I have waited long before watching this movie. The length of this movie scared me, so I kept postponing watching it. Recently, my fellow students kept reminding me that Interstellar is a must-see, so I tried. I can say one thing: postponing was a mistake. This movie is such a masterpiece. Everything is spot on. The thing I love the most is the music. Hans Zimmer killed it again. Without his compositions this movie would not have worked. The visuals are also beautiful. I never thought a sci-fi movie would feel so real. In short, I can honestly say I would recommend this movie. It is a must-see."
2019.09.22,0,Less than 10 stars is unrealistic. One of the best movies ever.
2023.04.11,7,"Nice effects but the storyline although very much hyped for its scientific accuracy is absolutely nonsense. Wormholes do not exist for a start. The view of the black hole might be somehow accurate but the idea that you could somehow get close to the accretion disk and survive is hilarious. The end of the movie is rather pathetic and free of any realistic aspect's. Maybe someone without any scientific background believes in the pseudo science of this movie but advertising this movie for realism is a very long shot. I was reading many reviews and had high expectations, but left the cinema rather disappointed. The movie is full of inaccuracies and I rather watch a fantasy movie like StarWars or StarTreck but not this pseudo scientific nonsense story."
2024.03.25,9,"Watched it again 10 years later. Absolutely brilliant. For sure a bit overwhelming if you are into space exploration and stuff but very well made. If you are not fully invested you will probably lose the plot so keep that in mind. Acting is incredible of course and visuals are stunning. What takes 1 point for me is the ending. And no, I'm not talking about the black hole. It would've been great if that was the final scene. Anyways, if you are wondering 'should I watch this movie' the answer is - absolutely, but only if you are fully prepared to be engaged all the time. It's a rollercoaster movie and it will stay with you for a while."
2014.11.13,7,"I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I'm a huge science fiction fan, and if Nolan had kept the 'realism' and tone that the first hour or so promised, I would've been more than happy with this film. Nolan's imagination is impressive, an expansive force that drives many of his movies. However, it is also his downfall in 'Interstellar,' a film in which he doesn't have the satisfying answers to reconcile the realistic fiction he wants to portray. The plot is littered with points that exist because, well...science. For instance, the characters refer frequently to an equation Michael Cain's character is investigating to solve a 'gravity' problem. But not much explanation is put for into how this would solve anything about bringing a colony of people into space. Finally, this opinion will probably cause many people to ignore me: I feel Nolan is still a very good filmmaker, but this movie glimpses him falling into the same 'black hole' (see what I did there?) which ensnared M. Night Shyamalan. Because 'Inception' and his Dark Knight trilogy were such a massive, profound success, he feels the need to make every ounce of dialogue ooze from the actors' mouths as if it's the most important, mind-altering thing you've ever heard. The movie becomes bogged down with long, dragging sequences of people staring as if in wonder, coming to realizations that are meant to inspire awe in us. However, these do little more than bloat an already over-long running time that felt like 7 years, but amounted to one Earth hour. The end serves up a slew of maddeningly predictable 'twists' that were pretty obvious an hour before the big reveal. I will say the acting is done incredibly well by the cast, even if their script is not always on par with their talents. As always, Nolan is exceptional with visuals, and most of the tremendously dramatic middle portion was effective, albeit borderline overdone with sap. I could've managed without as many repetitions of Dylan Thomas' 'Do not go gentle into that good night.' A beautiful poem that is awkwardly spouted throughout the film. A couple times was effective, five times was pretentious. This will not deter me from seeing future Nolan feature presentations, however, it in no way deserves the IMDb '9' rating that it has simply because it is Nolan. I can see why people would be impressed enough by the visuals to forgo the convoluted, flawed story, but not enough to land the film in any top 250. If this exact film were released under any other filmmaker's name (besides perhaps Spielberg or the like), I can guarantee you it would be far less lauded by audiences."
2014.11.18,2,"Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started... It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example. I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away) Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay 'tapes from loved ones at home' across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot? Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams 'That my father up there!'? Well the entire 'human' aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?"
2022.07.03,10,This is a masterpiece Movie ... Christopher Nolan's brilliance ... Interstellar is my favorite Movie ever. ... every time I watch this movie I get goosebumps. The background music was another level ... I love this music hans Zimmer whenever I hear Interstellar music I get goosebumps.
2024.08.18,10,"Truly the best of nolan and my favourite oat, ofc there is a diff between greatest and favourite this may not be the greatest movie but for me for sure is my favourite. This is the perfect film for me , there is no time that i watch this movie and do not cry , i also really like the sci-fi aspect of this movie too , too bad they didn't make a sequel maybe it's better that way. The acting especially of matheww is just so good i cant explain how or why he was in his prime in 2014 true detetctive and then this he was in the mood that year , flawless acting , those who didn't cry watching titanic will for sure cry on this one lol."
2023.11.06,10,"'Interstellar,' directed by the renowned Christopher Nolan, is an epic science fiction film that deals with the themes of environmental collapse and interstellar travel. The story follows a future Earth facing ecological disaster, with Cooper (NASA pilot) leading a team of scientists on a cosmic odyssey through a wormhole. Their mission is to discover a new home for humanity, leading to encounters with time dilation, relativity, and the strangeness/puzzling way of the cosmos. Below, I have listed what I think are the film's key strengths: 1. Performances: The cast, led by Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of Cooper, delivers performances that resonate on an emotional level. McConaughey's acting, along with Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and other cast members, infuses the characters with depth and authenticity. 2. Narrative: The film ventures into the realm of complex scientific concepts and seamlessly melds them with a profoundly human story. It interweaves themes of love, sacrifice, and the survival of humanity. 3. Visuals: Christopher Nolan's directorial prowess, in conjunction with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, created a visual spectacle. The film's depiction of the cosmos, the intricate wormhole, and alien planets leaves an indelible impression. Notably, the reliance on practical effects over CGI amplifies the sense of immersion and makes it seem even more realistic. 4. Brain Stimulation: 'Interstellar' engages the audience with its exploration of advanced scientific concepts, including time dilation and the craziness that are black holes. It offers a unique and stimulating experience for those intrigued by science. This is great for someone like me that doesn't really like to sit and watch movies. 5. Emotional Simulation: The film excels in evoking a spectrum of emotions, from heart wrenching separations to a profound sense of hope and human connection. The central father/daughter relationship adds a deeply personal layer to the grand cosmic story. To add to this, Hans Zimmer's musical score plays an instrumental role in intensifying the emotional impact of the film. The use of sound and silence within the vacuum of space amplifies the realism and tension in pivotal scenes. In summary, 'Interstellar' is an amazing movie that breaks the rules of traditional sci-fi. It has great acting, creative direction, and explores important themes that will stick with you. The film blends science and storytelling well and makes you feel deep emotions, making it a true masterpiece. If you love sci-fi and movies that make you think and feel, you should definitely watch 'Interstellar.'"
2020.10.28,10,"Nolan not only brought me to tears with this title but made me fall in love with the story and historic placement,"
2024.03.13,10,"I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY GHOST. Nolan once again takes us on a journey I've watched this movie at least 20 times I've watched reactions of more than 50 people watching it I've never not been hooked every goddamn time this movie needs to be played at my funeral this movie is the best movie there is and nothing will ever surpass it for me I watched it when i was 17, I am 27 and I'm still watching it, it simply NEVER gets old It holds the intensity the whole way the fact that this movie didn't win 14 Oscars utterly blows my mind. If you haven't watched this movie i don't even know what to tell you THEY'RE US."
2014.12.14,0,"The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways. The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention. Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time. More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from 'Forbidden Planet.' The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building. Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica. Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past. The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era. But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority. The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going.  Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect. On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important. A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?"
2025.09.01,6,"I've just rewatched Interstellar, and honestly, I don't know whether to give it a standing ovation or throw my remote at the wall. The first two hours? Incredible. Proper edge-of-your-seat sci-fi. The visuals are stunning, Zimmer's score is insane, and the whole time dilation stuff on Miller's planet is some of the best science fiction I've ever seen on film. That ticking sound while years pass back on Earth? Brilliant. I was completely hooked. And then... the third act. Cooper drops into Gargantua, and suddenly we're in this weird floating bookshelf dimension. All the carefully built science from the first two acts just gets tossed straight into a black hole. Suddenly, the big answer to the universe isn't physics or relativity - it's love. 'Love transcends space and time.' That's the line. That's the explanation. From there, McConaughey's crying into the fifth dimension, somehow tapping out the fate of humanity through a wristwatch in Morse code. Murph instantly decodes all this insanely complicated quantum data from a few ticks, saves the human race in an afternoon, and that's it. Sorted. Perfectly believable. It's such a shame, because the emotional core of the film - the father/daughter relationship - actually works. McConaughey and Chastain sell it. If Nolan had trusted the audience to feel it without spelling out the 'love is the secret of the universe' nonsense, it could've landed beautifully. Instead, it just feels... pretentious. For me, Interstellar is a film of two halves: First half - a tense, grounded, stunning sci-fi masterpiece. Second half - Nolan disappears into a glowing bookshelf and doesn't come back. It's still worth watching for the visuals, the score, and the ideas, but that third act stops it from being the all-time great it could have been. Verdict: A near-perfect movie that gets lost trying to be profound and ends up drowning in its own nonsense."
2022.08.15,10,There is no other movie like 'Interstellar.' They showed the facts 9 years ago and today we are getting to know that they were right. I went into it so deep that I forgot my own existence in real life. I'm kinda into 5 dimensional illusion right now. I can sit for hours just listening to the soundtrack they used.
2024.07.17,7,"'Interstellar' is one of Christopher Nolan's best-known films, praised by many for its compelling story and visual style. At the same time, although the film starts out really spectacular and interesting, it struggles with many flaws. Let me break it down. Nolan's direction is great, one of his most atmospheric ones besides 'Inception'. The film is visually outstanding, both the cinematography and the effects look beautiful. The performances are fantastic, especially from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The film's score is brilliant, Hans Zimmer's music is incredibly well composed and without a doubt, it adds to the atmosphere. However, although the story of the film begins interestingly and engagingly, it gets too confusing at the end. The ending feels way too much and completely out of place. Unfortunately, this is the low point of 'Interstellar', and even considering its strengths, it remained a mediocre experience for me. So, all in all, although 'Interstellar' starts really well, the ending unfortunately detracts from the overall viewing experience, and at the end of the day, it's nothing extraordinary."
2014.11.11,3,"This film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them, which results in an over sentimental mess that is called Interstellar. Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect.  This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker."
2022.08.13,10,It is a masterpiece especially on the big screen. For me it is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. The soundtrack fits perfekt and Hans Zimmer did a great job. I really can recommend this movie.
2025.02.11,10,"Interstellar (2014) - A Cinematic Masterpiece of Science and Emotion Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014) is a breathtaking sci-fi epic that seamlessly blends hard science with deep human emotions. The film, starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, explores themes of time, space, love, and survival, making it one of the most thought-provoking films of the 21st century. With stunning visuals, a gripping narrative, and Hans Zimmer's unforgettable score, Interstellar is more than just a movie-it is an experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Plot Overview Set in a dystopian future where Earth is facing environmental collapse, Interstellar follows the journey of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot turned farmer, who is struggling to provide for his two children, Murph and Tom. With crops failing and dust storms becoming more frequent, humanity faces extinction. When Cooper stumbles upon a secret NASA base led by Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), he is presented with a dangerous but crucial mission: to travel through a mysterious wormhole near Saturn in search of habitable planets for humanity's survival. Cooper reluctantly leaves his children behind, particularly his daughter Murph, with whom he shares a deep bond. He joins a team of astronauts-including Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and the AI robot TARS-on the spacecraft Endurance. Their journey takes them to distant worlds, each presenting unique challenges and dangers. Themes and Symbolism One of the most powerful aspects of Interstellar is its exploration of time and relativity. The crew's visit to a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, results in a severe time dilation-one hour on the planet equals seven years on Earth. When Cooper and Brand return to their ship, they discover that over two decades have passed. This heartbreaking reality is reinforced when Cooper watches video messages from his now-adult children, highlighting the painful consequences of his sacrifice. The film also delves into the concept of love as a force beyond time and space. Dr. Brand passionately argues that love transcends dimensions, and this is symbolized through Cooper's bond with Murph. Despite being separated by light-years, their connection remains intact, ultimately playing a pivotal role in the film's climax. Science and Realism Nolan collaborated with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne to ensure scientific accuracy, making Interstellar one of the most scientifically grounded sci-fi films. The depiction of black holes, wormholes, and time dilation is based on real physics, and Gargantua's visualization is considered one of the most accurate representations of a black hole in cinematic history. The movie successfully balances scientific realism with artistic liberty, making complex theories accessible to the audience without compromising the emotional depth of the story. Performances and Emotional Impact Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his finest performances as Cooper. His portrayal of a father torn between duty and love is deeply moving, particularly in the scene where he breaks down while watching messages from his grown-up children. Jessica Chastain as the adult Murph adds intensity to the film, showcasing a daughter's unresolved pain and determination to complete her father's mission. Anne Hathaway brings depth to her role as Brand, especially in her speech about love's power as an unexplored scientific force. Michael Caine's performance as Dr. Brand is equally compelling, particularly when he recites Dylan Thomas's poem Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night, which becomes an emotional refrain throughout the film. Even supporting characters, including the AI robots TARS and CASE, add humor and warmth to an otherwise intense narrative. Hans Zimmer's Score One of the most unforgettable elements of Interstellar is Hans Zimmer's musical score. Using a church organ to create a haunting yet majestic soundscape, Zimmer's music enhances the film's emotional weight. Tracks like Cornfield Chase, Stay, and No Time for Caution perfectly accompany key moments, making the audience feel the vastness of space and the urgency of time. Cinematic Excellence Visually, Interstellar is a masterpiece. The vastness of space, the eerie silence of distant planets, and the mesmerizing beauty of the black hole Gargantua are captured with breathtaking detail. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and Nolan's practical effects give the film a sense of realism that CGI-heavy sci-fi movies often lack. The use of IMAX cameras enhances the immersion, making Interstellar a must-watch on the biggest screen possible. Conclusion Interstellar is not just a sci-fi movie; it is an emotional journey that explores what it means to be human. With its brilliant performances, scientific depth, stunning visuals, and a heart-wrenching story, it remains one of the greatest films of all time. Whether you are a fan of space exploration, physics, or simply great storytelling, Interstellar offers a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally profound."
2024.04.04,10,"Nolan knows what he is doing, the time concept has to be the best one in this Nolan's movie making. It has to be my top 5 movie. The cast has been incredible with the performance. Fav scene has to be the one where Matthew McConaughey is in the black hole. That scene has to be my one of the favourite moments in the movie, the emotions were raw and couldnt contain myself but to shed a tear on the wonderful performance. I am a fan! I cannot stress the incredible work that Nolan has executed, in all different levels of performance it was just miraculous and I can watch this movie back to back without not being a fan!"
2022.11.18,10,"Removing the theoretical from physics ect. This film transmits an INCREDIBLE energy that reaches the soul, this soundtrack gives the art that a film like this deserves. I've seen it 9 times, of those 9 I've gotten goosebumps every time, but beware, there's never a feeling like seeing it for the first time. Please, if you are going to see it for the first time, turn the volume to MAXIMUM and enjoy this great work of art. And one of my recommendations is that you don't question the movie if you're already halfway through, maybe the first 1:45 will get you bored but, trust me, nothing is more worthwhile than waiting to see the end of this movie, don't worry. Questions what you see just enjoy."
2020.04.20,10,"When I watched this movie years ago, I got obsessed with it, even six years later I continue to watch the movie repeatedly. The story is unique. Yes, it is about space like many movies, but not a single movie about space can even come near to Interstellar. Your whole body is immersed in the plot, you are on the same emotional level as the actors, Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain but also Christopher Nolan who did a phenomenal job. My heart was pounding in those exciting scenes. I can't even describe how perfect this movie is. It is my all-time favorite and I can just recommend it to everyone."
2022.02.14,10,"This has to be the best space-related movie i've seen so far. All the effects were magical! Everything looked so realistic! It gets 10 stars, without doubt."
2014.11.07,0,"'Insomnia' is one of the top 200 films ever made. 'Inception' is one of the top 100 films ever made. 'Interstellar' is one of the top 50 films ever made. Also, Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is one of the top 10 comic book films ever made, but Interstellar takes Nolan's career to a level few have achieved. This film forever cements Christopher Nolan's place in cinema history as it will no doubt be one of the highest Academy Award nominated films in history (we shall see this upcoming March). I feel sorry for the film 'Gravity.' That film was so ground breaking in the Sci Fi/Space genre... but it only held the torch for less than a year. Interstellar blows Gravity away, like the '91 Bulls would have overpowered and embarrassed any class B college basketball team. Gravity is amateur hour compared to Interstellar- it's not even the same sport. Bold statements, I know but anyone reading this will eventually see the film, and you'll understand what I mean. Interstellar is truly a masterpiece for any generation and will be considered a pillar of achievement a century from now, much like Star Wars, Jaws, 2001 and Lord of the Rings are permanent pillars of cinema achievement. This is one of those films that changes the conversation. There has never been any movie like it, and there will never be another one like it- only imitators. Having said all that, do I really feel like Interstellar is a 10 out of 10? No, of course not. I'd say it's a 9.5. So for IMDb, that means 10. It's not the best film ever made, but it's in the same conversation as The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, E. T., T2, Avatar, 2001, etc. From this point forward, you can't have a conversation about ground breaking visual effects films, or ground breaking space dramas without mentioning Interstellar. It's that innovative. It's so innovative, in fact, that the slow start, cliché elements and improbable story set up have absolutely no effect on the film once it's over. That is rare my friends. That is a film worth seeing! Interstellar starts out slow and is overly sentimental as you'll read in a lot of reviews. You'll read that because it's true. Some of the dialog is off and the initial premise is not believable. Matthew McConaughey is one of our finest actors, but it's just not probable that an old NASA test pilot turned farmer would be seeked out by the now 'secret' NASA who was looking for him but didn't know where to find him, and once he happens upon them by a supernatural premonition, they put him on a rocket ship a few days later with no exercise, conditioning, or up to date training. Oh and he only lives an hour drive away from NASA's secret facility. Usually a film with those kind of strikes in the first 20 minutes... you're heading for trouble. But Interstellar starts slow and keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better... until the entire audience's jaw is on the floor (To see what I mean, give a glance at the audience during the act 3 climax and you'll see something you don't see very often. Total immersion. And if you don't watch this in front of an audience on IMAX, you've missed the point.) By the time Act 2 begins, it's so powerful that none of Act 1 matters. Again, that is so rare. Only a master filmmaker can design a film in such a way. Act 3 is where cinema history is made. It wouldn't be proper to give any spoilers here, as this is a must see film. I will only say that Act 1 is good, but partially flawed... and Act 3 is so strong that it makes the plot holes of Act 1 totally irrelevant. That never happens. Don't miss Interstellar if you have a chance to see it on IMAX! But regardless of how you see it, or when; it's worth your time and money and you'll be hard pressed to find a better new movie, over the next few years- especially with the all time low quality of Hollywood blockbusters and special effects showcases. Few directors have a command of the craft of filmmaking like Christoper Nolan does. In fact, I don't think you could say there is anyone better than Christopher Nolan working right now. He may not have the body of work Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Fincher or Soderberg have... but in the sci fi genre, Nolan is currently the best filmmaker in the world. Or you could say he's second to only James Cameron. Interstellar is a gift to us all on the same level as Avatar. Enjoy!"
2014.11.08,7,"In short; whatever your thoughts and feelings about Christopher Nolan's Inception will likely be the same for Interstellar. It relied on big ideas, very impressive CGI. A cast full of the best actors. A bit awkward in places and the plot had to be forced out of characters. Really, it was pleasant to watch a well made film.  The story begins as the world is ending, blight is taking over the world's crops. Those that don't starve will later suffocate, as the film describes. The biggest selling point for me was the science behind the movie. Kip Thorne wrote the treatment to this film.He previously worked with Carl Sagan on Contact and is the Feynman professor of theoretical physicist at Caltech. If those names don't mean anything to you then know that that means the films is going to be featuring a lot of talk about General Relativity. Time dilation is going to be involved and as far as I am aware it hasn't been done very well in films before. It still hasn't, but it makes the awkward and forced plot fun to watch plot.  I was sceptical about Matthew McConnaughey, he usually annoys me. He is accepting his maturity and has become a decent actor. I was very impressed with his work. The rest of the cast is full of talent but the weak script gave them no room for development, as is typical n a Nolan film. A few times they did get to go on a rant, they try to go deep and heavy, the meaning of love, survival, what time means. This never worked in he film. They are only human, maybe their musings were meant to be imperfect. When SCi-fi is at its best is when it debates these issues (hopefully in space). We only saw one side to each of them, a little monologue to stop the conversation and dramatically move on to the next scene.  The CGI was beautiful, but all CGI reliant films end up looking out of date after a few years. The acting was perfect, but the script was weak. The science was exciting, but it was over exaggerated and had those awkward moments where one supposed expert has to oversimplify a concept while explaining to another supposed expert so the audience can understand what is going on. Best of all, there were no sounds in space!"
2023.01.20,10,"Interstellar is one of my 3 favorite movies, it is simply art, the practical effects are very good, Hans Zimmer's music is one of the best in the history of cinema, the story is moving and emotional, the performances especially those of McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy are incredible. I don't know how Interstellar was not nominated for best film at the Oscars. It has certain similarities with Kubrick's masterpiece '2001 a Space Odyssey' even in some aspects surpassing this one. Christopher Nolan is one of the best current directors and this is surely his most complex and best made film in his career, surpassing the incredible 'Inception' or the best superhero film 'The Dark Knight' simply incredible."
2025.10.20,6,"Although this 3 hour joy ride had epic visuals and cool concepts, the writing ironically left massive black holes throughout. The characters repeatedly explain the story to the audience - e.g. Cooper's prepared spiel explaining his authentic backstory. Or they act wildly out of character, which is crazy given there's 3 hours for character development. For example, when the cold stern Dr Brandt suddenly launches into an inexplicable tangent claiming love is an undiscovered higher dimension. (And where did her crush on the other doctor come from??) I guess that's the directors attempting to juxtapose science and emotion. And things also just... Happen. How does coop go through a wormhole, into a black hole, and then end up back in Saturn's orbit within minutes of death? Why does the doctor create mass hysteria to leave urgently over a cough that the farm family have lived with for decades? How do coop and Matt Damon walk so far it takes the rescue craft miles to reach them? At least it had some kind of ending. The main character travels interstellar to get back to his daughter and sees her for 5 minutes. Fantastic."
2014.11.21,3,"The film is spectacular and starts off really nice and promises to be very interesting. But once the spaceship leaves the ground, the movie deteriorates rapidly, and as it progresses it becomes so unbelievable and ludicrous, that I left the theater quite annoyed and very disappointed. I didn't like most of the characters. They are clichés, and none made me sympathetic to their cause or character. The robot is also extremely familiar and it's design is ludicrous, trying to be both advanced and ancient at the same time. I really likes other films by the Nolan brothers, but it seems they don't give their scripts as much attention as they used to. A disappointment."
2022.08.18,10,"Easily a top 3 movie for me personally. Interstellar manages to keep relism in a space exploration movie, a feat few others have accomplished. Christopher Nolan knocks it out of the park again. If you're looking for a mind bending movie filled with action, twists and turns, and a soundtrack that will have you heart pumping blood through your body at an alarming rate then you need this movie in your life."
2023.10.01,10,The first time I witnessed the perfection of this film I was in wow. Before today I had seen it already at home 3 times and every time I enjoyed it even more. It's a masterpiece in every way every single time I start watching it I know I will cry at some point. In addition to the cinematography the music by Hans Zimmer takes the experience to another dimension. Today after all these years I watched it for the first time in theatre and the experience was beyond amazing. It's one of those movies that you wish you can erase from your memory and then rewatch time and time again. Thank you Christopher Nolan!
2023.05.06,10,"Pro's: Hans Zimmer created a sound track for this movie that will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best composed musical numbers of humanity and that's not even giving it justice The story behind how he created this number makes it even better (google it) Outstanding cast Every single actor in this movie gave a performance of a lifetime. Every movement, every line, every tear, every breath of these actors made me believe i was watching people's lives from an actual alternate universe and these were real peoples emotions. Absolutely flawless performances. The CGI They used actual data and actual theories on how things actually look in space and it's breath taking. The Plot In the end, it has you contemplating your existence. It has you rooting for the main character the entire time, on the edge of your seat an emotional roller-coaster Con's They did this movie so well, that there wont be another movie like this for a long, long time."
2024.12.12,10,"One of the greatest movies of all time the soundtrack is truly what makes it stand apart when I saw it in theaters again. I think I would run through a wall for Matthew McConaughey, incredible pull of emotions between determination, sadness and confidence. Anne Hathaway does a great job of making the viewer share the same emotion, while also letting curiosity and exploration drive the mission. Hoping to bring my girlfriend one day, but the concept of space time and inter-dimensional travel might be a little bit too much for her. So instead, I saw it with the boys!! Can't wait to see it again in 10 more years."
2023.11.09,10,"Best movie I have seen in my life This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. Movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
2022.04.25,10,"I was reading some reviews about this movie and I could not find one which was fully devoted to the music of the movie. And hell yeah, the music from this movie should be mentioned! This is a master piece. I could only listen to this movie and still enjoy it. However it also perfectly fits in the movie. The music made from this good movie a great movie. So please everybody, buy a dolby surround set, put it on the highest volume and enjoy!"
2014.11.21,0,"This movie would have been better if it was only about TARS and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue. All that hard science, special effects, scientists working together, making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion. This movie is really a cheeseball Hollywood film with a hard science backdrop. The characters were as flat as a piece of paper. The guy likes the girl, the daughter is mad at dad, dad loves daughter doesn't care about saving mankind. Even TARS had more personality than many of the movie's characters. The daughter was probably most developed but felt so off. Still she holds a grudge 30 years later. Is a movie for average joe blow using the bedazzle tactic of impressing you with confusing story, special effects and hard science when is really no meat and nothing useful TARS gets 10/10 rest of the movie 1/10 I have learned nothing. Made me think about nothing. Wasted my time."
2015.07.12,6,"This movie really isn't science fiction so much as fantasy with some mixed up elements of science in it. Sadly the movie lost me in the first 10-20 minutes or so simply because there is no scenario where Earth would have a blight or bad weather which would result in fleeing to wormhole would become a practical solution. On top of that the flight pilot thing is just ridiculous. The likelihood that you pilot through a wormhole based on human skill seems pretty small. So the premise of why people would want to do any of this was 100% flawed. Given X amount of resources the simply reality is that even if Earth is a barren ball of rock, it still has water and it still has the right gravity and better resources. So the solution would clearly be to just work with the Earth, not flee into the unknown in same sensationalized effort to save humanity. It really just makes no sense and when you base the premise and central motivation of your characters in a science fiction movie with a serious overtone like this and that motivation makes no logical sense, it's hard to take anything after that seriously. They may as well have been setting out to look for the Great Flying Spaghetti Monster to grant them the wish that would save humanity. At least that premise would have been honest and not some silly half thought out plot point skimmed over to explain all the uselessly risky decisions the characters would take later in the movie. There is also the whole idea that you'd expect a planet near a black hole to be a better place to live than Earth. It has to been almost infinitely easier to fix the Earth than it could ever be to transport the human population through a wormhole to a planet on the edge of a black hole. Nobody would ever think that was a good idea.  As I see it the movie was nothing more than a grand setup to show off the spooky theoretical impacts of relative time differences on humans. The reasoning for their trip was not well thought out and the ending of the movie was total crap. The part most people liked is the spooky sense of how time might pass differently when your near very massive objects. Of course in general it's probably not all that possible to find a habitable planet that close to a black hole. There are many factors beyond the massive gravity that would have either made the planet unlivable or make it simply too risk to call home vs Earth.  For the plot to work Earth would have to be about to be vaporized, not merely having bad weather and blight. Those things can be quarantined and engineered around as long as you have water, sunlight, resources and somewhere near the correct gravity. For instance when they are on the planet and the giant tidal bulge that appears out nowhere which would require a very fast planet rotation. Would it not have been immediately apparent that the planet was no in any way a realistic place to move humanity? It would be easier to just terraform Mars or again for that matter to fix Earth.  America is currently starved for good science fiction and the high rating of this movie is little more than a result of that. People are so desperate for a good science fiction movie they have overlooked the horrible plot holes. Contact is another example of a horrible movie getting good ratings because people are desperate for science fiction.  Even if you say OK, well this movie isn't really science fiction, but it's good. No.. it's just not. It's silly, misleading and completely lacks any kind of well thought out ending.  Watching this sad attempt at science fiction is just utterly disappointing. So much money was spent on such a bad plot and instead of instilling the mystery of science in more people it's just a silly mesh of unrealistic scenarios clinging desperately onto science to save the horrible writing. Robots with vacuum cleaner arms from the 1960s are more realistic than the plot holes in this sad movie."
2014.11.05,10,"Intersellar. What Christopher Nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simple,but we know that it's Christopher Nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. It's not. The overall plot is that the earth is dying so cooper(Matthew mcconaughey) and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. The acting is great,what makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. Every time they were together it was WOW. The visuals were on another level. If you can,see it on the biggest screen possible. Some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that, you will have a blast with this.Overall interstellar is a must see. I think it was Nolan's best film."
2022.11.03,6,"To be a 2.5 hours movie, it is watchable. The performance of the casting somehow keeps you interested. However, the science concepts they dive into, weather they are accurate or no, can be a little bit of a turn off and at the end the complicated relationship between Cooper and his daughter was the only thing that kept the plot alive. I just basically watched the whole movie to find out if he was able to came back to earth or not to meet again with her. So, yes, a kind of interesting movie, but if i have more than 2 hours to watch a movie, i would probably choose a different one. A little bit overrated i would say."
2014.11.09,3,"Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001. Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off? Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes! Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you! The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design). Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer. The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son). Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art? Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well. A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001."
2014.11.16,10,"'We're still pioneers. We've barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us.' Mankind has finally used up all of Earth's resources and it has become a dying planet. When Cooper (McConaughey) and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of NASA they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. Cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. I have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part I have found it easy to talk about every movie. This one I can't seem to find the right words for. The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius. I easily give this an A+"
2014.11.09,10,"OK, so I am not the type of guy that says that every movie is good but with Interstellar it is really hard not to. This is really a great movie. The story has been put together very careful and is extremely hard to follow but when you understand it, you realize that it is a good movie. Interstellar made me think about the science of the universe. And since a lot of information is correct in the movie (the content witch is used in the movie is what we are seeing in class right now) it can be in some way educational. But a lot of content they use is based on possible things. for example: I think is is a real possibility that there is a 4th dimension bus for us humans it is very hard to imagine that. But they make that unimaginable 4th dimension accessible for people. But since we and some scientists are not sure that the unknown information is true, is it awesome how the movie sticks together.  Interstellar: Great plot, it is awesome how the people who made interstellar take our imagination for a spin, and make the possibility that the content of the movie is reality so realistically possible. That is what makes this movie so great Wout Selosse, Sunday the 9th of November at 11am, Belgium."
2015.04.03,9,"At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion. I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally. Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next. Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role. I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked. All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride."
2015.02.22,8,"The first 80-90% of 'Interstellar' I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?! As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful 'Gravity', it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay."
2014.11.05,10,"A simply breathtaking film, Interstellar completely blew my expectations out of the water. The Nolan brothers took a huge risk in making a film about space travel, but they succeeded. The movie was one of the most visually stimulating movies I've ever watched. Be prepared to stare in awe. Hans Zimmer didn't disappoint with his original scores for the movie as well. Just wave after wave of amazing CGI and music throughout the film is enjoyable just by itself. But what I enjoyed most was the fact that the movie sticks to the main theme of human survival and curiosity. Everything that happens always links back to those themes. Not everyone will like the movie; some of the plot twists and more bizarre explanations the Nolan brothers came up with will leave some laughing, confused, mad, and/or skeptical. After all, it is a movie on the unknown. But, the Nolan brothers outdid themselves. You have to understand that there is so much in space physics and astronautics that humans cannot even fathom. You have to understand that what the Nolan brothers came up with could be true or not be true; there's no way to know because they came up the best interpretation for the movie based on incomplete data.  TL;DR, one of the best movies made ever so go watch it. go in with an open mind and accept that humans do not know everything about space."
2022.07.04,0,I am a firm believer that Time Travel is real. I may not be able to explain it with eloquence but I know that stories like this are based off of some random authentic account.
2015.01.22,7,"There's a lot to like in this film. The way it uses real and theoretical science, the way it doesn't pander to the Star Wars fans by showing space as it is, a soundless void. There's a great deal of thought surrounding communication across time. Ultimately though the film is flawed in many ways. Let me list them: 1/ The idea that food crops are failing across the world and yet people are shown still eating wholesome meals...there is still gas for the cars and power stations still work is somewhat incongruous to me. 2/ Matthew McConaughey is just not the right person to have played the lead role. He seems too laconic and the way he mumbled his dialogue at times was downright annoying. 3/ I don't think the US would allow school books to be printed saying that the moon landings were a hoax designed to bankrupt Russia. Political correctness, I suppose, will probably become more intrusive in the future...but THAT intrusive? 4/ The 'incident' with Matt Damon ('Dr. Mann') is just ridiculous and muddies the storyline and the pace of the film. 5/ The robot design is so impractical as to be laughable. Even the B9 robot from the old TV show 'Lost in Space' would have worked better. 6/ Will Hollywood PLEASE pension off Mr. Zimmer and his theme-less exercises in going up and down the music scales to generate tension. Much of the 'music' was loud and not appropriate to scene and there really was no memorable theme at all. Goldsmith would be turning in his grave! I congratulate the Nolans for trying to make an intelligent SciFi film in these times of dross. They have succeeded in many ways but the film is not the masterpiece 2001 is."
2015.01.23,10,"Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood. With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours. This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content. How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears. The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title. This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda. I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on. BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going 'super,' or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.)  The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool. Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours. Which is itself a strange contradiction. But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended. So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time. Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough. As I keep saying, a very strange movie. But a very powerful one *** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016**** Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I 'got' that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie."
2023.09.06,6,"I may upset & offend a few here, but I feel that the film has been part of its own hype. Where exactly would this film be without the special effects? I would consider myself someone who has a decent grasp of science, physics & astronomy, but the multi dimensional stuff was just annoying. Far too cliched, especially within the first hour with the secret base so close to Coopers farm. Let's assume within 1 day on dirt roads, & they are just about ready to launch, when he arrives, & has just enough time to go back to his farm. However, some attention to detail did seem spot on. There's no sound in a vacuum, something Hollywood seem to forget time & time again. Watched a second time recently, still really didn't do it for me. I'm a massive sci-fi fan but this wouldn't even appear in my top 10."
2022.03.20,4,"The premise here is relativity. Time vs gravity. The story, if there is one, is pointless. Christopher Nolan has surpassed Stanley Kubrick in making a visually stunning but ultimately pointless piece of Sci Fi nonsense. Nobody can give me a convincing explanation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in 1968 it was jaw dropping. Interstellar's problem is we've seen it all before, and Nolan is not Kubrick. Perhaps there is an analogy of the futility of life here, but it's spurious at best. This ranks with Prometheus as an incredibly beautiful waste of my time."
2014.11.07,10,"There used to be movies where the purpose of it might be giving entertainment, educating or enlightening them. But apart from most of the movies, 'Interstellar' is more than that. It is not a movie. You never realize that you spent 2 hrs 40 mins in the theater. It blends with you. It makes you a third person in the lives of the character watching then to go through all the experiences they have.  This is not a movie, this is an absolute experience that everyone should experience. It educates you, It questions you wit to the maximum level possible (How many of you understand quantum physics and Wave theory?) It raises an in-numerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain, Is that possible? The answer is yes and no at the same time. For believers, it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for non-believers, there are always questions that cant be answered.  Apart for science, the human connections are stupendous. It makes you to connect emotional not just to a character but to the future of the earth.  And the best part in the movie is subtlety in the picturing it. There is enormous possibility of making it more of a scifi journey showing colorful planets etc etc. But Nolan used what is required without going for too much unnecessary visual elevations.  The science, emotions, story & the screenplay are the best in the movie.  It is an experience that everyone should experience. Question your wits !?"
2020.12.08,10,After watching it i was paralyze for 3 hours. pure Epic!
2014.11.10,10,"Whether it is audacious or not, Whether it outdoes Kubrick's Odyssey or not,Whether it would get Oscar or not, That wont concern ! What matter is did I get the goosebumps or not while seeing ! And there it scores. You don't need to know General theory of Relativity. The Morse code, Wormholes, Spacetime can wait. you don't need to know physics at all. You just go to watch it and see the beauty of IMAX. Great performance from all those brilliant actors and actresses. And then the score by none other but the great Hans Zimmer ! But last, The Nolan brothers. Christopher Nolan delivers again. An epic voyage with lot of emotions. The astonishing cinematography is a pleasure to our eyes. Mankind is saved from destruction but it needs a great deal of courage and conviction. you get this here. Entering wormhole without violating physics is yet another milestone in the genre of science fiction. A monumental film with every aspects of life and science is depicted by Nolan."
2023.12.18,10,"'Interstellar' directed by Christopher Nolan was released in 2014. This film is about astronauts and scientists who went to another galaxy to find a new planet for human life. The soundtrack in the film keeps us focused and tense throughout the film. The plot is complex, fascinating and attention-grabbing from the beginning to the very end. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and many others. Scientists go into space where they have discussions, disagreements, disputes. The main breakthrough in this film was the image of a black hole. As for me, this is the best film in Nolan's filmography. Soundtracks, special effects, characters, plot."
2022.05.16,10,"This is my all time favorite Movie. It looks astonishing, the story is deeply human and the actors all do a great job at leading through this emotional journey. 11/10."
2023.07.01,10,"What words could describe this movie? Non. But I must fill this box up with letters so here are some words for you. You dont watch a movie and see all these means in it: life, death, survival, hope, fear and joy all while the hero is trying to save the world but you feel as if this is a real story from our universe or from a parallel universe or from a non-parallel universe, it doesnt matter, what matters is that you feel that somewhere sometime this story could've happened or would happen. How do you make a story so imaginary yet feels as realistic as our existence? I guess its Murphys law. How do you have all these means in this movie but ultimately make me feel that it was just a movie about a father and his daughter? I am blown away. Every single time. Ive played this movie 10 times and the only thing that bothers me when I start losing myself in it is that it didn't grab all the oscars that year. But hey, I saw that movie called 'Everything Everywhere Everyone All Together' or something got all those Oscars and thought 'good riddance' Best movie Ive seen in my life. Only one that beats The Godfather."
2025.10.17,0,"The characters lack of complexity and real problems, I mean couldn't they have more of a real problem like having diarrea and coughing at the same time or Alzheimer with diarrea, I mean that's a real problem not just having to travel through the space and time and type shi. I will just let it like this because of my aunt Ricky, but my opinions about the movie will grow larger every time I watch it."
2018.06.10,7,As of 11 June 2018. It is a max 7/10 on a good day
2014.11.07,10,"If Memento was ambiguous, if The Prestige was smart, if Inception was deceiving, if The Batman Trilogy was a revelation, then Interstellar is hope-giving, inspiring, levitating, flabbergasting and more... It's a roller-coaster ride of transcendental thought process. Time as a relative theory, astrology as a whole, time-travel and lot other high level thinking is mandatory to go about the narration of this movie when our very little brain cells have a tough time differentiating between just a movie being watched in a cinema hall or being part of a galactic expedition. Interstellar is a science-fiction movie about a group of space travelers on a picaresque journey across the wormhole to find a habitable planet other than earth. Sounds familiar? We've had Blade Runner, A Space Odyssey, Contact or the recent Gravity along with numerous other ambitious takes on such top level prophecies, but what makes Interstellar a suffocating, impactive film? The amount of study that has gone into the making of the film is equivalent to a new find. Be it the concept of dimensions, futuristic world, or the unexplainable topics to the laymen, this story from the Nolan brothers is rather simple than all their previous outings. Interstellar in simple words, is a film about a father-daughter relationship.  Taking the 'Dust bowl' as a primary setting for the story to have a beginning, Mr. Cooper is a farmer by choice but a trained pilot and engineer by profession. He is a single father who still believes the plight of their blight filled earth can be taken over by inhabiting another planet. His bright daughter Murphy doesn't want him to go on a NASA powered voyage fearing his return. Let's stop it there on making a futile attempt of describing the story. Interstellar has propelled itself to the pinnacle by an undeniably superior story, astute screenplay and stellar performances from the uncanny yet stubborn Mathew McConaughey as Cooper the pilot, Anne Hathaway as Amelia a committed scientist, Micheal Caine as Dr. Brand the chief and Jessica Chaistan as Murphy the abandoned daughter. Double Negative has taken up the herculean task of doing the visual effects for a Nolan film and has re-created unseen visuals of the wormhole, the outer space, inhabited planets of the other galaxy and of course the beautiful earth. The graphics and other digitally composited elements in the film are pretty much the life-line for the film, making the unseen portions of outer space look so convincing to us and not a compromised, make-believe platform. How will the engines of a space shuttle sound, how is sound transmitted in a planet that has only 80% gravity, how does a button sound when it is pressed by a finger that has astronaut's gloves on it? Hans Zimmer can never get tired of writing top-class music scores. Be it the nail-biting sequence of the shuttle docking into the mother-ship or the take-off into the space or the scene where Cooper gets to watch a video sent from his family, the musical support in the film is a parachute like life-saver for such a hard-hitting story. He elevates the film and positions it to an unreachable height of excellence and creativity. Interstellar has been filmed with anamorphic 35mm and IMAX 70 mm to give a different visage for the story. Hoyte Van Hoytema's (what word could you think of to describe his skill) cinematography will become a standard procedure on how science-fictions are to be shot.  Made on a whopping budget of 165 million dollars, Nolan almost returned 10 million after filming from the original allocated budget. Private corn fields were bought and cultivated to be used as a major backdrop. Special IMAX cameras were made to shoot the interiors of the cockpit. Exclusively Robots were made for the film. 100 hours for rendering a single CG powered frame and what not first-timer for a film. Interstellar has started a race of its own for generation of film-makers to follow.  Einstein's general relativity, Morse code, rotating black-hole and lot other complexities are dealt in Interstellar, but it is an emotional tale about the cosmos of survival. This piece of writing has no spoilers and talks nothing about, how great the film is. It is just an immediate response"
2020.05.22,7,"Not Nolan's greatest work, Interstellar is a slow burn mind bender but it keeps you in the game until the end, and features stunning visuals and a great cast. Recommend to Nolan fans."
2014.11.11,5,"It's not a bad movie, but it's ordinary at best. Dialogue is very clumsy at times. It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself."
2015.04.08,9,"It may very well be the most remarkable film I've ever seen. Interstellar is a film which plays on your emotions more than anything else. Many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific inaccuracies, and thus, let these factors detract from what would otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. Interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. Interstellar will, I feel, become more appreciated as time passes, and will, I hope, one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made."
2023.10.02,10,"The father-daughter relationship of Interstellar is often overseen, yet Nolan did an extraordinary job in this domain with Matthew McConaughey perfectly executing it. As a father who has a daughter, I'm deeply impressed how Nolan touched on this subject every time I rewatch it. It's so deep, it almost gives an ideal blueprint of how to connect with your kids on an emotional and intellectual level, and how to be the right parent for them. Any father, especially with a daughter, would understand what I mean! :) It's pure gold. I have a very close relationship with my little daughter, we are best friends, in some way similar to that of Interstellar, and I've always tried to prioritize it, but I find myself always learning something new from Cooper and Murph. As a huge sci-fi fan, I'll even completely ignore the sci-fi part in this review! :))"
2015.04.09,9,"I was very interested in this movie, my expectations were very high, luckily I have been satisfied! I can't say it's a masterpiece because I found something that could have been better ( there's an apparent hole plot and some characters could have been realized better) The plot is very difficult and articulated, science is really complicated! Besides movie is very long, but it can not bore, rhythm grows up to the end. The photography is breakthaking, scenes are spectacular and do you not fell the long-duration! screenplay is fantastic, music is fundamental for the movie ( Hans Zimmer composed a fabulous soundtrack ). The special effects are perfect, worthy of an Oscar! Unfortunately, in my opinion, Interstellar has not had the attentions it deserves it's a film you have to see! 9/10 absolutely! not to be missed!"
2020.11.12,10,"Apart from the great cinematography, storyline and acting. Interstellar will keep you on the edge of your seat. The first time I watched it I was amazed that a film could be that awesome. Christopher Nolan is a true genius. After the first watching I promised myself that I had to wait 5 years to watch it again. And I did! For 5 years I ignored everything about Interstellar so I would forget it and watch it like the first time. It worked and it was as good as the first time! I could watch it over and over and never get bored"
2019.02.26,10,"This film has Drama, Action, Suspense, Emotions, Love, Environment Caring. Just Love it"
2023.02.18,10,"I've had a strange relationship with this movie over the years. I didn't have the chance to see it in movie theaters when it came out, but caught up with it on streaming release & immediately liked it except for some sections of jarring dialogue & unnecessary exposition - which admittedly took up only about 2% of the movie, but had an outsized effect on me because - well - I expected and desperately wanted perfection. When I viewed it the second time, I was even more angry with the Nolan team for the few mistakes of the film. After all, this was the movie I'd been waiting for someone to make for years. Why couldn't it have been perfect? I saw it a third time. Why, you may ask? Because despite the errors the story haunted me. And I had to admit to myself that it was beautifully executed & acted, with possibly the best soundtrack in movie history. It was on this viewing that I managed to just let go & relax into the film. I was stunned. How could I have missed this masterpiece? A complex, tightly knit, scientifically accurate story (Kip Thorne won the Nobel prize in physics later in 2017) that seemed to have been plucked right out of some fictional ether, instead of painstakingly worked out around a table in a story room. Some stories are like that; they feel more real than real, like they've always existed and were waiting for a hand to snatch them and gift them to us. It occurred to me too that some works of art, like this film, can have a sort of 'emergence' - that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and that it may well take time for a culture to come to recognize its true greatness. I see now that the flaws of this film are very small and actually don't matter at all. The movie's greatness transcends its own mistakes. I don't know if any movie will ever be made to match Interstellar. As sad as that makes me, I'm happy enough to just keep watching and re-watching. If you haven't seen it yet - I envy you."
2020.08.30,0,"Rating this film a 'masterpiece' on any scale is preposterous.Gushy, weepy and incoherent. Everyone is crying trying to figure out what dimension they are in and finally they discover it was all about them and they are in love and weep some more."
2015.06.05,7,"When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction. The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all. The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar. Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems. See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf. Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter. At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act. When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here. 6,5/10"
2015.04.02,10,"Cinematography is amazing. The only thing that top's it was the acting. Engaged from start to finish. Played with my heart and head like it was as simple as pulling strings! The physics was sound! Educational, the story line brilliant! The idea of playing with time in this fashion is bran spanking new. Mixing the idea of the afterlife with relativity to time being another dimension which can simply be traversed as if were an extra dimension and linking all these together....FANTASTIC! I'm definitely buying the DVD! No sob stories! No boring and predictable Hollywood romance! Just straight up brilliant story telling. You don't watch something for 2 hours+ and think, 'gosh, where did the time go', if the movie wasn't that awesome! Really cringe moment with Dr Man... but we see this is in real life all the time. The greats failing at the most pivotal of moments. You may be really smart... but this story is about how love and bravery and the shear will to fight for what is a deepest of core values of the human race - survival as a species."
2023.04.03,6,"A decent movie with a lot of production values and star power but at the end is just too surrealistic. You'll hear all the usual imdb rants: magnificent, a triumph, a masterpiece but its all overblown. Slowing a movie down making it mysterious and putting the stakes so high only gets you so far. The movies starts well and who can't get enough of Anne Hathaway's gorgeous face but like the heralded soundtrack after a while it is overhelming. Not every Christopher Nolan movie is a masterpiece from frame to frame. Not every action or lack of action has earth shattering consequence. Sometime its just a highly produced and directed movie that should of had a fresh pair of eyes look at the script before it went into production."
2014.11.11,5,"Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?)  Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.)  Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below! 1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did. 2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent. 3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work. 4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. )  5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?)  The above really killed the movie for me. Sidenotes: A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.)  B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done. C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away? D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.)  Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale. I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again."
2015.04.02,10,"'Interstellar' was and is a masterpiece. Rather than watching a film, the movie simply feels like an experience that not only requires thinking and thought process, yet also creates an experience of a variety of emotions. The film is perfectly crafted with an extremely talented cast, a deeply interesting plot and idea, a score of music that ties the whole film together with a perfect bow, and stunning and incredibly realistic visuals that make you seriously wonder if you are in the movie with McConaughey. Speaking of McConaughey, he and Hathaway simply shine, yet the rest of the cast does a phenomenal job, making the movie a powerful piece acting wise. I suggest this movie to anyone and everyone, and it is perhaps the best Nolan film out there."
2021.05.22,10,"This movie is outrageously brilliant in its concept, and delivery. The concept is so intricate yet beautiful. This is one of the best pieces of art ever made."
2014.11.12,9,"Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!! 'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE.  To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as 'THEY' has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves. In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too. Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty. Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies. Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about. The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions. Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!"
2014.11.12,10,"Similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers, this is my first review. If it happens to be my last as well, I wouldn't mind. This movie warrants a review. The night before seeing 'Interstellar', I had watched Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey,' which may have been the best movie of its decade/century as well. I was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of Kubrick's masterpiece, and I was worried that seeing it so soon before 'Interstellar' would lead me to great disappointment in Nolan's film. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. 'Interstellar' lived up to Kubrick's 'Odyssey' and will be one of my favorite movies of all time. Nolan's movie certainly didn't surpass 'Odyssey'; the two occupy a very different space (no pun intended) in my mind and in the annals of cinema. I can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a sci-fi film, and they cause all others to pale in comparison. Even the recently- released and acclaimed 'Gravity' has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces (another great pun).  Without spoiling any of the film, I would like to discuss some details that impressed me. The score is phenomenal, the acting is powerful, and the special effects are superb. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to Kubrick's 'Odyssey' which made the dual-experience even more significant. Certain elements of the film reminded me of Kubrick's 'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite' sequence, the mysterious monoliths, even the legendary HAL-9000. Even with these slight similarities, so much of the movie was different, and in enough ways bolder, such that 'Interstellar' feels incredibly fresh and original. Christopher Nolan co-wrote AND directed this film, which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation. Even with his hard-to-match lineup of prior successes, this movie is a phenomenal standout. The run-time felt very appropriate, and just like 'Odyssey,' I was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points. Please treat yourself to a theater experience of 'Interstellar.' If you love sci-fi, if you love the realities of space and astronomy, even if you only love great film making, you will love this movie."
2023.01.16,10,"Well, well... where to start?! This one stays in my heart and head for a lifetime. It's been almost 9 years since the release of the film, and still it gives me that emotion I felt in the movie theater for the the first time watching it, especially on IMAX. Christopher Nolan delivered another instant classic with an unforgettably beautiful and touching soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. It's a very deep and complex story, but once you understand what you've just seen, you realize how magnificent it is. Somehow, in a good way, this movie changed my life and I am grateful for it! Truly he best film I've ever watched or felt. P. S. I'm a film editor and someday I (hope) will work with Nolan. :))"
2021.06.10,10,"Truly a masterpiece. One of my personal top 2 movies of all time. This movie is suspenseful, makes you think afterwards, is emotional, contains all kinds of exciting twists, has one of the greatest soundtracks I have ever heard.... I could go on and on..."
2016.02.14,6,"i was expecting to see an exciting sci-fi film which will keep you watching till the end due to its high rating, but it was a disappointment.  it has several problems in no particular order. 1. the robot's design is too simple and ugly. it was basically a square with a computer screen in it. if people can send spaceship beyond the moon, shouldn't the robots have more functions? this ugly robot doesn't even have two hands. it can't really do anything other than talking.  2. the robot's voice sounds just like matt damon. i thought that they want to save money, so they just used the same actor. it made the film sounded cheap. 3. cooper the character didn't do anything scientific, all of sudden, he was flying a spaceship into the deep space? that didn't make sense. 4. lack of asians. in 2016, black people are protesting lack of 'diversity' in Oscar, this film didn't have any Asian faces in it. there are more Asian scientists than blacks . this film failed to hire Asian actors."
2022.02.08,10,"One of My favorite movie of all time. An amazing mind boggling adventure that only Christopher Nolan could pull off. On top of that Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely exceptional and one of my all time favourites. A great story, too. Nolan just did it again and can score another great film. A true Masterpiece."
2014.11.22,7,"I could not wait to find a cinema that showed this movie, especially after two of my close friends went as far as to saying that it was beyond a doubt one of the best movies of all time. Honestly, I don't think it's the case. It will be one of the top movies of the year but that's about it. Christopher Nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens, every step of the way so we don't get lost. It becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. Another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point, where Anne Hathaway says something along the lines of 'nothing is more powerful than love'. Please! Get serious! On the positive side, the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. Probably better than Gravity.  All in all, considering the type of movies that get done these days, Interstellar is definitely one to watch."
2017.09.26,4,"Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic. It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's 'Baron Munchausen', the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the 'serious' movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word 'fractal'. And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops... A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized. A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A 'ghost' communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could. Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan). Please, stop the stupid 'expert's presentation how it works' (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in 'The Martian' explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the 'expert' addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot. ...and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on... and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help. To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on? My '4' rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating."
2022.01.13,9,"Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' is one of the best 21st centuries films. It greatly depicts the struggle where humans must find a suitable place for their population to continue when the planet Earth becomes no longer habitable while simultaneously making the viewer think to fully understand the story of 'Interstellar'. Hans Zimmer has created the most breathtaking and suitable music for this film, arguably one of the best pieces of his career. The writing and visualization of the characters is superior to every other movie that I have seen. 'Interstellar' writing is impeccable, because like some of the best written pieces the story leaves the viewer to think and shows only what is necessary to understand the story. The movie is capable of showing the struggle that is to find a habitable place for human race. It is so because wherever they look, it turns out to not be survivable. The soundtrack written by Hans Zimmer manages to suck the viewers inside of the story, making the audience feel almost as they are between one the main characters and feel the emotions going through them. It can show tension when there is one and showing fear when there is fear. All that just by the power of sound. Truly remarkable. Nevertheless, this movie can show emotions almost like no other. In the scene where Cooper returns to the main ship and views all the videos and messages that his family has sent him through the years he didn't live, he experiences many different emotions. Christopher Nolan can make the audience experience these emotions. In conclusion this is a film that stands out between the best of films. By making the viewer think, experience the emotions of characters while listening to one of the best movie soundtracks, 'Interstellar' has to be placed in the list of best 21st century movies."
2022.01.21,10,"This movie is breathtaking, it's wonderful in all respects, the acting was the best, the script was I can't imagine better than it, the direction was amazing in Christopher Nolan's wonderful way, the visual effects and sound effects were great, and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was very great."
2018.08.18,10,No matter if you can understand this movie regarding science.the love between cooper and murph is the key.and the promise of a father
2022.06.21,10,"This film will flip your world upside down, turn it, twist it, throw it across a baseball field and flip it back. It will change the way you look at reality and take you on an emotion rollercoaster ride as you do. One of the better films I've ever seen. A nearly flawless movie with superb acting and visuals."
2024.12.01,10,"This is my first review, and Interstellar is the perfect film to start with. I've watched it 8 times, and each viewing reveals something new. The visuals are stunning, and the story's mix of science fiction and deep personal stakes makes it unforgettable. Matthew McConaughey's performance as Cooper is truly emotional, and the film's atmosphere, with Hans Zimmer's incredible music, really pulls you in. Every time I watch it, I find myself thinking about the universe and our place in it, making it a film that's not just about what happens on screen, but also what it leaves you thinking about afterward."
2020.11.04,10,It deserves much more..... It drove me crazy.....NEXT LEVEL!!!!!!
2014.11.10,0,"The first few minutes were good and promising. However soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster cliché, even if in an unusual packaging. Let's compare it to Transcendence. Despite its few flaws, Transcendence depicted a very realistic scenario from beginning to end. It was reasonable with its depiction of humans too and remained so throughout. Not so this one. It was made for the masses and the whole premise is stupid. The scary thing is that this salivating 'blockbuster' is cheered with a 9 rating while Transcendence is written off as something unreal."
2015.06.23,6,"To explain my daring title - I'd like this review to be a counterbalance to many over-enthusiast appraisals. Yes, it is a good action/drama. Yes, it is a spectacular science-fiction film. Every genre fan's dream: travelling among different worlds (though, try to watch Europa report!), bending the laws of 'common sense' newtonian physics and playing with blackholes and wormholes (the space-bending explanation is just a shameless 'borrowing' from much older Event Horizon). Though, this movie betrays the 'common sense' in yet another way. its plot. 'We have destroyed this Earth, let's find another one.' Irresponsibility, anyone? while we may argue - if this is not a premise of every beloved pot-apocalyptic distopia, if 'space travel' is not what we want from science-fiction at the end of the day ... this movie dared to start with really hot topic, so boldly that it should be judged by its own 'higher standards'. So we have an ecosystem collapse in the beginning - It is quite obvious that the reason of it are monocultures stretching towards the horizon - a direct consequence of machist, industrial, technocratic approach to science, progress, planet, life, agriculture, thinking... The root cause is so clearly visible in every picture frame of the down-on-Earth part of the movie - but the only 'solution' offered by the writer(s) is again the technocratic one: 'Let's build super complex machines to transport us zillion light years away' ... instead of simple (!) cheap (!!) responsible (!!!) fixing of the darned monoculture issue down on our original planet. While many claim that this movie is sophisticated if not even intellectual - it is not - it is actually offensive to the intellect. There might be many of the-good-old space travel operas, whom I would forgive this and spare them the 'common sense' critique. But not Interstellar - because it pretends that it is 'aware', 'eco-conscious', it pretends that it urges us to think about our relationship towards the planet, but it fails exactly in this point. Thinking. Watch Avatar and Home instead."
2023.02.09,10,"After more than 10 years have passed since watching this masterpiece, I finally write a review about this incredible film that still leaves me moved by the whole story, marvelling at all the sci-fi details. I do it while listening to the soundtrack which is also unique and legendary. We are very small compared to all the things we know (and think we know!) about the entire universe. This film gave me the same feeling of humility, curiosity and fascination that I had the first time I saw a film of the same genre, which was the one starring Jodie Foster and the same Matthew McConaughey, a bow and tribute to my old favourite film in the sci-fi genre 'Contact', more than justly replaced in 1st place by Interstellar."
2016.10.31,7,"Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there. I really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, 'we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?' only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was OK with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing. Overall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5."
2014.11.25,5,"I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie, I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it 'more immersive' apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old. And by the end of the movie, so were the endless references to 2001. Sheesh. A good amusement park ride, yes it is. But it's still considerably below the bar set by Gravity last year."
2023.05.06,10,"The best and most exciting drama and exciting movies in the world of cinema are often directed by Christopher Nolan, and Interstellar also belongs to the same category of films. This film, which I also offer to you, tells a story full of excitement and drama along with brain and fascinating topics. Directed by Christopher Nolan in Interstellar, he has used beautiful music and rich images to describe the story. In this film, a world is depicted in which everything is different and attractive. Following the amazing journey of this movie, you can enjoy its great pleasure. In short, Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the best and most exciting drama and exciting films to be offered for any cinema interested. The best part of this film is not only its beautiful and attractive images, but also the deep concepts that are expressed will take you to another world."
2022.08.19,10,The story is so confusing for a normal audience but if u keep your mind intact through out the movie especially the climax part you will be blown out the thought process of the movie.
2022.01.21,10,I have seen it more than 5 times so far... I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space.
2023.02.11,9,"I recently watched Interstellar and it was truly an amazing experience! The visuals were spectacular and the story line kept me captivated throughout. The soundtrack was also incredibly beautiful and powerful, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film. The acting, especially from Matthew McConaughey, was superb and added a great deal of emotion to the scenes. Overall, I highly recommend Interstellar to anyone looking for an entertaining, thought-provoking movie. Interstellar was an amazing movie! It was gripping, suspenseful, and emotionally resonant. The visuals were stunning, and the soundtrack was beautiful. Every performance was top notch. The story was complex yet easy to follow and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. This movie is a must-watch for any fan of science fiction. Highly recommended!"
2024.12.09,10,"Really good. CHISMIS POINTERS 1. Timeline - June nag-break sila ni Rico. Nasa very dark place sya and very lonely and vulnerable. 2. Anthony was very sweet to her. Caring and talking sweet things and comforting her. 3. Since the start na everyday sila magkatrabaho sinasabi ni Anthony na single sya and since single din daw si Maris that time, she make patol. 4. Sept 8. Nag-Italy sila and their relationship went deeper. And still Anthony is confirming na single siya. Birthday niya pauwi sila super caring parin ni Anthony and that's why she did a My Day to appreciate him. 5. Halloween they went out public and they are sweet kase alam nya single si Anthony but Jam posted some My Days and even without names, alam niya ano yun. And the bashing started daw. 6. Ilang beses daw nya inask si Anthony and he gave her an assurance na single sya. And kinumusta niya si Jam (as per the screenshot) because she is trying to just check Jam's wellbeing kasi alam nya na hinehelp sya ni Anthony for some medical stuff. 7. Ilang beses nya inask si Anthony na mag-public statement na single sya like he always says kaso sabi ni Anthony na he needs time and Maris doesn't want to be pushy and agitate him. 8. She is sorry and don't want to play victim pero she's sorry sa public that we have to see her intimate side but she said that's what she is when is love or like someone. 9. She tried to reach out to Jam to know what's up but didn't get any response and she's sorry for Jam. But she said din nya talaga alam. 10. She made a mistake. She doesn't know how to move on from this. She said whenever she goes out she feels like a naked woman. And she's sorry to the people who supported her for the past 10 years. But she will continue to work and she is just a human being. Bottomline: Si Anthony may kasalanan. As per her. -Kim Garcia /FTTM."
2024.12.10,10,"Hans Zimmer's Mesmerizing Score Hans Zimmer's score is another highlight, blending haunting organ compositions with moments of silence that amplify the vastness and isolation of space. The music enhances the emotional intensity of the story, making every scene more impactful. Themes of Love and Survival At its core, Interstellar is not just about space exploration; it's about the resilience of the human spirit, the power of love, and the sacrifices we're willing to make for the future. The relationship between Cooper and Murph is the heart of the narrative, grounding the cosmic scale of the story with deeply personal stakes."
2014.11.23,0,"When I first saw previews of the movie, I thought it looked really sappy and unappealing. But then I saw it was a Christopher Nolan movie and I thought it had to be good. I love all his movies: Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION. He's made so many great movies, I thought there was no way it could be that bad... well it was. The movie starts out and the premise just makes no sense. I don't understand what humanity's problem is in this movie. Humans survived for literally 100s of thousands of years before farming was invented, but all of sudden we're all going to die just because we can't grow wheat and okra anymore. It isn't explained satisfactorily at all. People have cars and electricity, but they can't have an MRI machine? MRI machines are not that hard to build. The world of Interstellar makes no sense and they don't even try to explain it. But the biggest problem is that the movie is boring, so very boring. We start out on this boring farm. I couldn't wait for the main characters to leave this boring planet, but they just dragged it out with the sappiness and the 'please don't go!' There are so many scenes that just seem to pointlessly drag on and make you wonder why the editor dropped the ball so much. Then when go off into space it gets a lot more exciting... some of the time. Thinking about grativity, and relativistic time effects is pretty cool, but this is puncuated with some odd interpersonal conflicts that don't really play out in a compelling or sensical way. For some reason Hollywood has decided that romantic relationships aren't compelling anymore. That sort-of makes sense, it's kind of silly when movies are about two people who just met and then all of sudden they fall in love and are willing to kill and die for each other. But they have replaced romantic relationships in movies with something less compelling: boring, undeveloped relationships. The main character has a son and a daughter, but for some reason the father doesn't seem to care that much about his son, and instead the movie revolves around his relationship with the daughter. But honestly, I did not care about them. None of the characters were particularly interesting or likable. You could replace the actors with any other big name actors it would not have made much of a difference. There was so much in the movie that I just plain old didn't understand. A lot of scenes in the movie that were supposed to be exciting and suspenseful just fell flat, because I had no idea what was I was supposed to be rooting for or afraid of happening. Much of it isn't exciting because of the fundamental nature of what is going on on screen... like watching someone trying to figure out the answer to an equation, while some dramatic music plays. That's just not exciting. The worst parts of the movie, besides the nonsense and plot holes, was the weak philosophizing on the nature of love and its relationship to science, and that kind of thing. Blah blah blah evolution, survival instincts. The movie does has depth, but when the characters go off on some philosophical exposition it just comes off as pretentious and shallow. They never make a single point about love that is even slightly original or though-provoking. But the movie isn't all bad. I like the Robot AI character. The movie had some unique visuals and situations that are memorable, they should have been used in a better movie... And so in conclusion, this movie is okay. I'd recommend it if you have nothing better to watch."
2019.03.08,7,The vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. This movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. Open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.
2025.02.03,10,"My number one, all-time favorite movie. I just saw the 10th Anniversary Edition in IMAX, and wow. It still blows me away. Everything about this film just works for me. The story is epic, spanning vast distances of space and time, yet it's also deeply personal. It explores big questions about humanity's place in the universe, our survival instinct, and the very nature of time itself. Seeing the vastness of space on the massive IMAX screen was breathtaking. The planets, the galaxies, the black hole - all rendered with such incredible detail and realism. It truly feels like you're journeying alongside the characters, experiencing the wonder and the terror of the unknown. The sound design is equally impressive, creating a truly immersive and visceral experience. From the rumbling of the rocket launches to the eerie silence of deep space, the soundscape perfectly complements the visuals. But what truly elevates Interstellar for me is its emotional core. The relationship between Cooper and Murph is the heart of the film, and it's what makes the story so emotionally resonant. Interstellar isn't just a science fiction movie; it's a movie about hope, about love, and about the enduring power of the human spirit. It reminds us that even in the face of overwhelming odds, we are capable of extraordinary things. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits have rolled, prompting you to ponder your own place in the universe and the connections that matter most."
2021.10.12,6,"A movie that starts out very strong, great acting and a great storyline that seemed to deteriorate halfway through."
2014.11.07,1,"It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy',   'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the   movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've   experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the   current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad.    The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this   blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and   stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his   daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what   in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of   events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was   apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no   easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if   they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means   they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose   McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this   purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's   office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational   alternatives?    On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT   TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions?   While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble   attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he   would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime   for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into   how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on   the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was   hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying   to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could   do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require   his daughter 25 years to figure out.    And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named   after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and   they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same   thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without   needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity   saved in the same way.    Grand ideas don't make great movies if you can't deliver them   properly... It is atrocity to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece..."
2022.08.24,10,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar incorporates space, family and loss to create a powerful film. Although science fiction the movie comes across realistic, with no sound being used in outer space. Through Christopher's imagination we was able to see a depiction of the unsolved mystery of what is in a black hole One of Matthew mcconaughey best performances, surprised we haven't seen more of Mackenzie Foy given her how great she played young Murph. This is my favourite Sci-fi film and in my top 5 films ever made."
2024.12.07,10,"Interstellar is out of doubt one of the greatest and most beautiful stories ever told or put to screen. The level of humanity this movie offers is astonishing. The movie is about a father who travels trough space in order to save his family, by finding a new home for mankind because of Earth has been heavily polluted and does not longer have the capacity to sustain human life. The protagonist, the father named Cooper is then forced to make the hard choice to either leave his family in order to have a chance of saving them, or live with them until the end. He chooses to go out and save them and the movie is all about this dilemma and how this affects himself and especially his daughter Murph. The movie later presents a lot of interesting themes and dilemmas involving the characters' choices and the plot itself. Family and humanity is in focus throughout the whole story, with love and struggle to reunite with loved ones. According to myself the ending of Interstellar is one of the most emotional and heartbreaking endings of all time. And it's also one of the most satisfying and built up. The whole movie is a journey and it builds up to this bitter-sweat end that leave the audience fulfilled and possibly teared up. Lastly Interstellar is one of the most meaningful movies about humanity as a specie and about a father and daughter story. It's one of the greatest movies of all time and the best movie of the 21st century, and is 10 years later still as important, and will forever be important as a great movie about mankind and the love we feel for each others."
2024.12.16,10,I need 70mm IMAX in my life forever I need to watch every movie in this format. Anyways interstellar was amazing took my dad to see it with me and it was his first time and he was mind blown even tho I saw this before I was still avoiding spoilers and the sound was incredible and the scene where he's driving away from his kids and the rocket lunch's I got goosebumps everywhere 😏 and the screen was huge it sucks I was in the second row but it was still amazing but there was some scenes where the bass was very high it was blocking out the things the characters were saying and my ears blow up but other then that sound was incredible and the graphics amazing old school 70mm had the old style in a new look and cinematography was amazing like it always was and I was holding back tears during that scene were he was looking at the messages from his kids dam. If Monday wasn't sold out I would definitely go again. 10/10 And btw I started the clapping at the end so I'm now 😎 Cinematography 10/10 Story 10/10 Acting 9/10 Sad scenes 10/10 Comedy 7/10 Action 8/10 Sound 10/10 some scenes 6/10 Effects 10/10 Looks 10/10.
2022.06.24,10,I cried like a baby. I love Christopher Nolan. I love the Batman movies and Memento was awesome. Interstellar is worth seeing! Highly recommend. Go see it if you like christopher nolan and space. Really cool.
2020.09.09,10,"Interstellar is the most powerful movie I have ever watched before. This experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. A brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think, performances that can drive you to tears, editing that feels out of this world, and above all else, a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. The drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist, per se (although Matt Damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen), but instead, from the simple concept of time. The writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific, and I would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. So many of the scenes are masterfully laid out, and can be so dramatic. One of the best scenes is when Cooper is leaving, and Murph runs to her father, crying, only to find that he's not staying for her, even after she told him to go. This film is even more powerful later on, when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf, telling him to 'stay', was actually Cooper, in the future. As the music builds, Cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented, and he would have seen his daughter grow up, but now he will never be able to do that. This is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life, for everybody else's life. Learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist, and watching the betrayal on Murph's face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. Matthew McConaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film, and he seems so genuine of a person that it's hard not to feel bad for him. Every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good, even down to the minor characters. The twists in this movie are beautifully done, and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could. What absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by Hans Zimmer. Every piece of music is intense, tear-jerking, and unequivocally beautiful. This movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. How on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me. This is the greatest science fiction movie I have ever seen in my life, and this is certainly Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus."
2022.06.01,10,I thoroughly enjoyed this and the music was spot on. I felt it was really different to the usual stuff of the genre and the storyline remained interesting though out.
2014.11.16,0,"Hot off the heels of the scientifically impossible Lucy, comes 'Interstellar': another movie that worships science and implies that one day it will turn us all into gods; gods who can control our own destiny. For those of you who don't know what motivated Hollywood to make this movie, I will try to explain. The Baby Boomers, the generation that gave us Star Trek and Buck Rogers, were convinced that space travel would solve all the world's problems. Technological advancement would eventually allow us to travel to distant galaxies. We would meet aliens. These aliens would be atheist-socialist-geniuses who would show us even more advanced technology than our own.  The new alien technology would allow us to overcome death and live in perfect happiness. But, more importantly, they would prove to us - once and for all - that there is no God. Humans are the most advanced life forms in the universe, and they will eventually achieve God-like power as long as they continue to do scientific research.  Now, none of these wild fantasies of the Star-Trek-Generation have come true. In fact, the more we learn about the universe the more we are beginning to see: 1) We seem to be alone 2) We will likely never travel beyond our own solar system 3) The universe was very likely started by an intelligence. Technological advancement has not occurred as fast as many Boomers were hoping and has failed to fulfill their grandiose fantasies. In order to compensate for these sobering realities, the Baby Boomers have modified their fantasies. The reason science has not advanced is because people don't think scientific advancement is important, especially those evil religious people! Fortunately, the evil corporations (evil capitalists) are destroying our planet through global warming and environmental abuse. Eventually the planet will be so damaged we will have to find another one. When we do this, the Boomer fantasies will finally be fulfilled.  Besides the usual environmental and scientific propaganda, the movie also contains your typical feminist propaganda.  The movie begins on a farm where Matthew McConaughey is talking to his daughter and son. Before the conversation even began, I knew the daughter was going to be a genius and the son was going to be a moron.  I am not kidding. I have witnessed the 'boy-idiot, girl-genius' paradigm so often that I no longer expect anything different. Affirmative action (both for women and minorities) is inevitable, and, quite frankly, I am getting tired of it. This is coming from a person of colour (really). If there are going to be brilliant scientists in movies you can practically guarantee that one of them will be female and the other will be a minority. I use to applaud these efforts in shows like Star Trek, but now I am just getting annoyed by them"
2021.11.28,6,"Amazing visuals and an epic feeling overall, but the film itself is a overly long and moves too slow at times. Matthew McConaughey is very good in it though!"
2020.10.31,10,"Now this is what I call science fiction. I had been waiting for so long for a movie like this before it finally came out. It's a masterpiece. Unforgettable soundtrack, stunning visuals, tense action scenes, touching story that always make me cry like a baby. And SPACE. This movie is everything a space geek is looking for. Many years have passed and no movie can surpass the emotions this one gave me. That's why it's still my number one. Maybe_not_so_interesting_fact: scientists consider this movie to be very scientifically accurate in many points. But it's still science fiction. So enjoy!"
2014.11.03,6,"Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate."
2014.11.08,3,"Feeling very disappointed given all the hype and rave reviews. What a bunch of utter pseudo-scientific crap! The so-called 'scientific advisors' must live in a parallel universe with completely different laws of nature. The characters are as flat as two-dimensional entities. The only realistic holes are not wormholes nor black holes but the gaping holes in the storyline. How come Hollywood these days always seems to take fascinating science fiction-themes and mangle them into some commercial junk that is all about fiction and has not the slightest thing to do with science? Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is still light years ahead of the rest of the pack, almost 50 years since that brilliant film was created. Don't waste your money on this farce but buy a good book instead and create your own space-time adventure on your comfortable couch at home."
2025.05.23,10,"Honestly, Interstellar is the best movie I've ever seen. It completely blew my mind. The story, the visuals, the emotions-it's on a whole other level. From the very beginning, I was hooked. It's not just about space or science; it's about love, time, sacrifice, and what it means to be human. Matthew McConaughey's performance as Cooper felt so real. You could feel every emotion he went through-especially the connection with his daughter. That father-daughter bond hit me hard. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. That music gave me chills. It made every moment feel 10 times more intense. Visually, the movie is stunning. The way they showed the black hole, the planets, the spaceship-it all looked so real and so beautiful. It's one of those movies that makes you feel small, like you're just a tiny part of something way bigger than yourself. And the ending? Wow. I didn't expect to feel that emotional in a sci-fi movie, but Interstellar isn't just sci-fi-it's something deeper. It makes you think, and it stays with you long after it ends. If you haven't watched it yet, seriously, do it. It's not just a movie-it's an experience."
2019.10.13,10,"This is the first and maybe last review I'll ever write. I'm writing it after seeing this movie for the third time and I feel that I'm ready to say that this it the best sci-fi movie of all time. If cinema is to be included among the arts, then this is a timeless masterpiece to cherish and Nolan is the Michelangelo of this industry. Yes.... I like this movie quite a lot...."
2024.12.09,10,"This movie is quite moving, worth the watch.years later Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant."
2020.10.31,10,"I love this film, it has great acting and screenplay- combined with great visuals and fantastic storytelling."
2024.12.09,10,Awesome film! Awesome film! I hope you understand it and I will complete it with you in the morning if so much for you I will be able to your account details and I will complete your payment and send it back to you so the transaction payment will automatically be received on your account so you can to receive the payment successfully immediately you 8 receive the your payment payment immediately you receive your deposit immediately 8 8 your payment payment immediately your payment payment immediately 8 the payment immediately you 7 receive your payment immediately immediately you receive your payment.
2023.02.08,10,"This movie is the most beautiful, creative, realistic and emotional movie that I have ever seen. I genuinely believe that this movie is the most perfect movie ever. This movie has everything: love, betrayal, suspense, mystery, action, happiness and connection. This movie is just done so well. The plot is so well written. It is very hard to stop watching this movie. The casting is amazing. The acting is over the top. I am starting to think that Matthew McConaughey is one of the best actors ever. The VFX are a beauty and the characters? Don't get me started. The dialogue is written in such a mysterious but realistic way. I am in love with this movie. This is also a very long movie and I do think that it is a bit of a headache but I would be lying if I said that my mind wasn't blown because it was! I don't think I will ever see another movie. 10/10. You have to watch this movie!"
2022.03.28,6,"Quite boring. The character's weren't believable. The plot had some thrilling bits, and the cinematography was nice. At one point, for a brief moment, they imply that if humans got the opportunity to build a perfect world exactly to their liking, it would look like a 1970s American suburb. That's the level of insight this film is working with."
2018.09.28,10,Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful
2022.03.27,6,"Is mumbling great acting? Seems like Hathaway and McConaughey mumble the entire movie. It's almost as if the dialog in this movie isn't really meant to be fully understood. Not much about this film can be easily understood because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Lots of cheap sentimentalism. I love science, but I find this a middling, mildly interesting movie, not worth it's recognition."
2024.04.07,10,"In my view, this movie is a masterpiece in every way, with outstanding music, professional acts (especially Matthew McConaughey), dealing with scientific facts, and explaining points most simply and understandably for the audience. This movie has attracted me so much that I'm willing to watch it again more than ten times and not get enough. During the movie, my mind kept going back and forth between scientific facts and human emotions to the point where I often felt like I was related to the characters and got involved in the story. I recommend 'Interstellar' to all scientific and drama movie lovers. (I don't use the word 'sci-fi', I think 'Interstellar' did its best to stay away from fiction.)"
2020.11.04,10,I have seen many Sci-fi movies in my life. But this is the Best Sci-fi movie I have ever seen. All the scenes and storyline is just The Best. I have no words to describe this movie.
2015.11.25,9,"I'm a big fan of anything Sci-Fi and I've always been interested in the boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. While most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often prioritize the 'Fi' over the 'Sci', Interstellar is one of those rare gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly entertaining movie. Any doubts I had going into the film about a dramatic SciFi being directed by Christopher Nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie and its tremendous score began. While Nolan excelled with The Prestige and Inception, they did leave something to be desired and I was fresh off the Batman trilogy bandwagon. But Nolan excels yet again, directing the film with such confidence and control that it's almost impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Each and every aspect of his signature style is also prominently visible through the film.

2022.08.13,10,"This is a masterpice, nothing else to say, it is perfect to the beginning to the end, the plot, the cinematography and the actors, everything, i mean, for me is the best film i ever watched."
2025.03.15,8,"The three things I love most about this film: the visuals, the soundtrack, and Matthew McConaughey's performance. The sight of space with Earth in the distance made me feel both lost and deeply moved. Hans Zimmer's Cornfield Chase elevated that emotion to another level. The moment Cooper shed tears was the moment I did too. I thought about my father, about my childhood cousin whom I was close to, about my loved ones. Strangely, I thought about family while watching this film. Though Interstellar carries many profound meanings, for me, the most important thing about a movie is its ability to immerse the audience in emotions. And Interstellar did just that."
2026.01.03,10,The best three hours I've ever spent in front of a screen I've watched this movie more than seven times and it still impresses me every time It is completely free of explicit scenes profanity alcohol and weapons yet it deserves a 10 out of 10 rating A true masterpiece Matthew performance is absolutely stunning the script is brilliant and the film speaks to both the heart and the mind The soundtrack is enchanting moving powerful and unforgettable This movie stays with you long after it's over and you will feel a strange unforgettable sensation after watching it Finally I recommend watching it in a suitable atmosphere with a cup of coffee full focus and patience.
2017.03.15,0,"It is just unbelievable that a movie with a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, a movie that generated two research papers and a science book (The Science Of Interstellar) written about it by the Caltech scientist that was part of the production crew of the movie, has such large plot holes. Here are the most obvious and idiotic plot mistakes on Interstellar 01 - If Cooper was the 'ghost', trying to communicate from the future, and he was trying to stop himself from traveling into space, why did he provide his past self with the coordinates of the NASA station?? this makes no sense.. if it wasn't for this event, he would have never gone into space!!.. All he had to do is to stop his present self from doing something he knew he did before in the past...  03 - We currently have the technology to scan far away solar systems for planets like our own, planets with water, with an atmosphere, and with reasonable temperatures, As of 2017, scientists have found a few of these earth-like planets in nearby galaxies.. so in the future, we won't even have the ability to tell whether a planet is a complete antarctic wasteland or not?  03 - If an alien intelligence was advanced enough to create a worm hole to another part of the universe, why didn't they choose a part of the universe that had at least a planet that is easily recognizable as habitable for colonizing humans? DUH 04- If an alien intelligence was advanced enough and had such power to rip the fabric of space time and create a wormhole, why didn't they have the technology to relay and communicate the information needed to save mankind to scientists? That idea sounds a lot more logical that a far-fetched trip across the universe through a wormhole, etc etc...  05-For decades humans have been sending robots and probes, out into space to explore and learn. In the movie we even have a few robots that appear to have human-like or above human intelligence. So why send unreliable, mortal humans into space by themselves, knowing there weren't enough of them to colonize a planet. Yes, i know about the whole plan A and plan B, but if plan B was secretly the idea all along, why split the expedition into single parties? that makes no sense.. it would have been impossible due to time and resource restrictions for a single human to span a colony in an eco-friendly planet, even with the plan B technology described in the movie. I am a big fan of Inception, but parts of the plot of this movie are completely idiotic (in other words, typical Hollywood fare), and that is accepting out-there sci-fi ideas like hibernation, traveling through blackholes and wormholes, and other silly liberal / leftist idiocy, like the idea that humans will someday will stop making weapons, etc.. Sorry Dolan Brothers, Interstellar is a nice and typical Hollywood, silly, but completely idiotic movie, made for public consumption, that is about it."
2014.11.27,6,"mediocre acting overuse of dialog to explain the back-story and fake/contrived science. It's like whoever wrote the script is some 'enlightened meta-philosopher' (RE: psychedelic substance user)with an overgeneralized and topical understanding of astrophysics. Most people that have enjoyment studying astrophysics will be horribly annoyed watching a bunch of actors blabbering and playing 'experts'...if you know a little about astrophysics you will find it cringe-worthy. Matthew McConaughey was mis-cast; he doesn't have a believable character in this one...same with Hathaway. They both come across as if they don't even believe the sincerity of their own lines - the dialog is very weird and almost forced at times, especially with bizarre out-of-place technical and/or scientific jargon that would never be brought up among expert colleagues (i.e. Nolan overusing dialog to inform the 'dumb' audience about the background 'science')  It's less of a story, and more of a writer trying to force-feed their own gnarly philosophies to whom they must deem a dull and uninformed audience. It could have been a lot more, but Nolan chose to sit on the fence as far as what type of sci-fi it would be, whether fantastical or 'realistic'. So where's all the hype from? The liberal media that can't help but interject politics into everything...the idea of an Earth uninhabitable conforms with their world-views about climate change, so they completely overlook the actual film itself. Overall very boring... If you're looking for Star Wars, Star Trek, Serenity, etc...look elsewhere...If you're looking for a recent watchable sci-fi; I'm usually not a fan of Tom Cruise's movies, but his last sci-fi, 'Edge of Tomorrow' wasn't half bad...at least better than Oblivion."
2020.09.06,10,"This film here made three hours feel like a walk in the park by the amount of attention it I gave to it. From the opening scene to the credits, my full attention was on the screen."
2015.04.02,6,"This movie has achieved a very high rating on IMDb and so I had a very high level of expectation before seeing it. My one concern was that I've found Nolan's recent work (particularly Inception) to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. I found Interstellar to suffer from the same faults. Very interesting ideas, great cinematography, solid cast (although I wish Matthew McConaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. He doesn't seem to have fully recovered from his role in True Detective and I couldn't understand what he was saying much of the time and I was not alone in this. A number of reviewers have used the word 'epic' to describe this movie. I'd be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. A friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from Earth to Saturn and when you see Interstellar, it feels like you're making the same trip! An exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. Not all bad news however - some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular, although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources - obviously 2001/ 2010 and Arthur C Clarkes story 'Rendezvous with Rama'. Definitely worth seeing but I don't share the 'masterpiece' line of some reviewers. Good but not great."
2014.11.08,5,"Christopher Nolan has made some great films, but alas, this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. Here's hoping Mr. Nolan gets back on track next time out."
2024.12.15,10,"Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's. But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing. Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's. Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's."
2021.01.02,10,"The best movie I ever saw and I watched hundreds off them from Godfather, Pulp fiction, The green mile, The pianist, Schindler's list,"
2024.12.08,10,"Watching Interstellar was nothing short of an extraordinary journey that left me in awe long after the credits rolled. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema, taking us on a profound voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning as it is intellectually stimulating. From the moment Interstellar begins, you are thrust into a future Earth on the brink of ecological collapse. The desperation and urgency are palpable, setting the stage for an epic quest to save humanity. What struck me immediately was the film's ability to blend grandiose science fiction with deeply personal storytelling. The relationship between Cooper, played masterfully by Matthew McConaughey, and his daughter Murph is the emotional heart of the film, grounding the cosmic adventure in a relatable human experience."
2021.08.27,10,"I wanted to see this on the large screen so badly when it was coming to theaters, but nobody in my immediate sphere could see it with me. So on an afternoon in December I say all by myself in the theater to see it in the middle of the day with almost nobody around me. Probably for the best, considering how badly I bawled my eyes out in various parts of it. Firstly, the characters, both principal and ancillary, are all played with great effectivity by all the people involved. You care about these people. Not just because the represent hope for the species but because of how vested they are in mission success and in each other. You even care about TARS as well for goodness sakes, and he's a robot (but I cared about Data and Bishop too, so there's that.) The story was paced as well as it could be, considering how much story there was to tell in only 2 hours 40 minutes. Second, if you watch it the first time it's a science fiction movie about survival, humanity, time, space, family, etc. When you watch it from the vantage point about it being a father-daughter movie, it completely changes the tenor of things and makes it all that more emotional of an experience, in addition to being a visually compelling one. Once I relayed this to my own experience as a father to a daughter of my own, my empathy level for Cooper went off the charts and catapulted this film into one of my favorites of all time. Lastly and I think most importantly - THE SCORE. Oh good great goodness, Hans Zimmer has been a favorite of mine since I bought the Broken Arrow soundtrack in my high school years. But this is probably his masterpiece. The breath of the billowing organ, thrust against the ambient, dissonant and sometimes harmonious synthesizer work brings this sense of our organic essence in relief to the machinery that is thrusting us into space and enabling us to achieve greatness as our earth is failing us. This score is only more captivating with further listening and you will remember everything you felt in those moments without a single image in front of you. A great movie, delivered by an epic score. It's everything I want in the film experience."
2020.09.17,10,"I had a special interest in science since my childhood. I tried to read all the sci-fi related books. During the shutdown, I watched a lot of movies as well as a lot of documentaries on science. When I heard that my favorite director Christopher Nolan directed a movie in astrophysics, I was shocked. I watched it as soon as possible. Honestly, I will not skimp on rating 10/10 in each of Direction-Acting-Score-Cinematography. Moreover, it is only possible for Nolan to get impossible details in the necessary places, accuracy as well as not to drag complex science in unnecessary places or take the help of fiction in the interest of the movie. I missed some key points without seeing the problem of sound mixing and without subtitles for which I see it again in print the next day, seeing it properly, I realized that Nolan has created a masterpiece! It will be more enjoyable to watch the movie as a drama without trying to understand it as sci-fi. Because human emotion has been given priority in many cases here. Even in some cases Nolan has ignored science in the interests of the drummer. So in the end Interstellar is more of a drama than a sci-fi, which conveys a more beautiful message about love than many romantic movies. Of all the powerful dialogues in the whole movie, this one seems to me to be the best. Not to mention the soundtrack of the movie. Some music plays with people's emotions, at the same time can bring different kinds of feelings, can put pressure on the nerves. One such score is Interstellar music by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has previously worked with Nolan on Inception, The Dark Knight, and you must remember what a terribly beautiful creation the music track was. Interstellar's cast made me even more excited about it. While immersed in the true character of True Detective, Matthew appeared in the role of Cooper, along with one of my favorites, Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy, but even if you haven't seen Mackenzie Foy before, you can imagine that this box of cuteness will grow into another Jessica Chastain! It also seems wrong to expect Nolan's movie to be simple linear. Interstellar seems to me parallel non-linear (although I doubt if there is anything with this name). Something happens before, and some happens at the same time. An attempt was made to describe the incident linearly. People reach a stage where they have to be developed from 4 dimensional being to 5 dimensional being. 5D sees time as a dimension so they can navigate at any time. These 5 dimensional human beings are THEY! But time is also a physical dimension for 5D. It's like you can see all the events laid out in front of you, you can see your birth, your school life, your marriage, your death ... As long as humans are 5D, the earth is destroyed, so they are located in another galaxy. But if they come to this other galaxy, it will take a way that was not discovered until the earth was destroyed. Wormholes are a type of quantum anomaly. At the quantum level, it is seen that electrons can move from one place to another without passing any time. This concept is called wormhole. If the wormhole could be created in the form of a mass, it would be possible to pass two light-years apart almost any time apart. It is not possible to create wormholes naturally due to the huge amount of energy and dark energy required to keep them warm and stable. But 5D people have found a way to stabilize wormholes. This time they created a wormhole and placed one end of the wormhole near Saturn in our solar system, the other end in the galaxy where future humans will be. So this time we need to transfer the people of the world to a new place. For this they choose Murph K. Murphy's father, Cooper, is a NASA engineer and pilot, and Murphy is exceptionally intelligent. From Morph's bookshelf comes the Morse code signal 'STAY' which is sent by Murphy's father Cooper, a 5D Tesseract created by Future 5D Human. Because the first time Cooper enters Tesseract, he thinks he's stuck here forever, and nothing would have happened if Past Cooper hadn't been on this mission. Then Cooper realizes the power of Tessaract. Tessaradact is a 5D model, so he can navigate at any time. Grace received the necessary information about the singularity for the Gravity Equation Solve from Tarsus Black Hole, which he was converting to Cooper for Morse and sending to Cooper Murph controlling the second hand of the clock. If space-time is continuous multiverse we can never see another universe but gravitational pull. That's why Cooper uses Gravity for contact. Data from Singularity from Murph Cooper and data from Romley's Black Hole all solve the Gravity Equation, which was started by Professor Brand. It is through the gravity equation that the massive Cooper station and the people of the world begin their journey from the earth to the human new home to use gravity. Meanwhile, as soon as Cooper Murphy finishes sending all the info needed for gravity equation, the purpose of the Tesseract is fulfilled, and the 5D closes the Tesseract and sends Cooper and Tarsus back to Saturn with a wormhole. ('The first handshake as Cooper crosses the wormhole) The Rangers found and rescued Cooper as he passed Saturn at Marfra Cooper Station. Suffice it to say, wormholes are so far only possible at the quantum level. Although the black hole was discovered, no information was found inside its event horizon. The tesseract part of the ending is completely fiction, even if it doesn't say May be 5 dimensions so far only in theory. String theory also speaks of 9 dimensions. But so far nothing has been scientifically proven. Maybe 'they' will answer these questions."

2015.07.19,0,"I'd heard fairly mixed things about this film, and often heard praise for elements that I think one shouldn't lead with, so I did put off seeing it until very recently. The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film, and I can see why people love it, hate it, and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever. To get it out of the way, there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long, and at some points this almost seems deliberate – like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time, with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However, while it doesn't all come together, the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning, with believable space travel and worlds created, to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble, you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical, visionary stuff, is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional, even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people, with their flaws, their pain, their motivations – it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard. Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong, although to just pick one – Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film, while he completely nails the emotional content, which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time – because we see how it hits his character, so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes, heart, and brain – it doesn't all work, like I say, and it is far from being the perfect, flawless film that some would suggest, but it is engaging, thoughtful, heartfelt, and very well made."
2017.03.24,6,"'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment. Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time. Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun. In fact it's void of anything that will make you change your expression. This is just one long, pretentious and self-important film that isn't anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest."
2024.12.12,10,"Captivating. Intense. Breathtaking. Why did it take me 10 years to watch it. They do not make movies like this anymore. A Nolan masterpiece. Shout out to Zimmer on the song track, complimented every scene perfectly. This is a film you can watch over and over again. The imagery when they entered the sphere by Saturn was amazing, with the 'first hand shake'. Couldn't have done it any better. When Dr Mann decided go rouge and blew up the station was a great scene, the silence after was deafening. Amazing performance from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway were brilliant. Complimented each other well, and drew us into the characters straight away."
2014.11.10,7,"I was really looking forward to watching some decent sci-fi and when I was this was on at the local regal cinemas I decided to check it out. Jumped on IMDb quick and was shocked to see it had a 9.3 rating at that time...maybe it was a mistake to look at the rating, it may have pushed my expectations too high. I was expecting something 'over the top' good, and it just wasn't. The movie could have used more technology and more serious thinking and dialog. The revelation at the end I saw coming probably in the first 30 minutes of this nearly 3 hour movie. There are some good and exciting moments, and there are definitely scenes that have the cool factor, but it is not a 9.0+ movie. I give it a solid 7. It seems a lot of people enjoyed the movie a lot more than me and that is great, but this is my opinion of it."
2025.03.17,4,"I don't know what I expected, apparently I never read the synopsis or watched a trailer, I watched it simply based on hype from others. I'm so tired of 'end-of-the-world' movies and shows. I either didn't realize or thought this one would be better than the others, but it wasn't. I'm sure my bias played a big role in why I had a hard time looking this movie. So for that I feel it's impossible to give a fair rating, but the app forces me to put a rating so I'm putting it in the middle. Other than my recognized bias, is hard for me to pinpoint why I didn't enjoy this movie. I'm no cinema expert so can't articulate well what things I didn't like. One possibility: A good movie should fully engage you, pull you into the world they've created and allow you to suspend disbelief. This movie did not do that. I was questioning things almost the entire time. Another possible reason is the pacing/editing of the movie just felt weird at times. I don't know how to explain it better. I understand there's a lot of time jumps, but the way it was done didn't pull me into the story. The first half of the movie had me bored. The middle started to amp up and there was a twist I actually wasn't expecting and I thought it might have a better ending. But then the 'twist' at the end just made me cringe and there was no way I was going to like this movie by the end. I just don't see what all the hype was about this movie. Was it terrible? No. Was it worth watching? Maybe? Will I watch it again? No."
2019.03.12,10,"I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost. Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember. Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers. I laughed , Cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. An instant 10/10 that gets better on viewing. I can't stress how much I recommend this film. Drop what you're doing!!"
2024.12.11,10,"Interstellar is a bold and ambitious film that pushes the boundaries of science fiction while delivering a deeply human story. Though not without flaws, it is a visually and emotionally unforgettable experience. For those who appreciate thought-provoking cinema and are willing to embrace its complexities, Interstellar is a masterpiece that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. 1. Visual Mastery: Nolan collaborates with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema to deliver some of the most awe-inspiring visuals in cinematic history. The depiction of wormholes, black holes (scientifically informed by physicist Kip Thorne), and alien planets are as breathtaking as they are grounded in theoretical science. 2. Hans Zimmer's Score: Zimmer's organ-heavy soundtrack is haunting and majestic, perfectly capturing the vastness of space and the intensity of human emotion. The music is as essential to the film's identity as its visuals. 3. Emotionally Driven Storytelling: At its core, Interstellar is about the enduring bonds of love, particularly between a father and daughter. McConaughey's heartfelt performance anchors the film, and Jessica Chastain shines as the grown-up Murphy. 4. Ambitious Themes: The film tackles big ideas like the survival of the species, the nature of time and gravity, and the resilience of the human spirit. It doesn't shy away from challenging its audience intellectually and emotionally."
2021.11.01,9,"The movie is a true masterpiece. From the advanced renderings of the galaxy to the soundtrack, everything in this movie is just mind blowingly good. The details like a distant ticking noise that happens in the background every 1.25 seconds on Miller's planet, means one day passes on earth. These details is what makes this movie, but not on its own. Get comfortable, and pay attention to everything, you will not regret watching this."
2021.05.22,10,"Wish I could see this in the theater. The scoring is a masterpiece. This is one of the best scoring in cinema. And how Nolan told us about the 5th dimensions is simple yet outstanding with remarkable visual that leave the viewer speechless. At least that's what I felt. No doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time."
2020.08.21,10,There are no words to describe this masterpiece. I just remember back in 2014 having watched it 7 times at cinema! I wanted to enjoy every moment Interstellar was running.
2021.09.11,10,"TARS: 'It's not possible'. Cooper: 'No, it's necessary'."
2015.01.03,0,"just hate Nolan; or Nolan-lovers should I say! constant bombardment of science humbug (correspondence to theory is not the point). contrast it with the silence of 2001! contrast it with the film it tries to imitate. Now an average sci-fi story is elevated into the rank of greatest films, without even a solid cinematic base, except those visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise. You science-geniuses all needed this information overload to accept a not-even average story as a cinematic masterpiece. How I hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside Battlefield Earth or Armageddon etc., when the Nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade away."
2015.04.20,6,"If the underlying logic is missing, the story overly simplistic and weak, then spending 160 million on production isn't going to make it a great movie. The potential is huge but the end result feels lacking. This may well could have been a real masterpiece with a bit more thoughtfulness and work. It has some interesting science wrapped around a meager plot.  It may well have sky high ambitions, very good production value, actors and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. It lacks even the most basic logic. How this can be considered as intelligent and philosophical is beyond me. The science is heavily dumbed-down and simplified, presumably to appeal to a wide audience. The overall script is extremely simplistic. The philosophical aspect shallow and empty. The whole is wrapped into a fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience. Matt Damon gives his worst performance to date (blame the script). Anne Hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place. Matthew Mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games, the only thing missing is the occasional 'yeahaaaa!' like a cowboy. I applaud the ambition but overall it's a mess. A mess with silver linings. BUT STILL WORTH THE WATCH."
2018.09.25,10,"Science Fiction can definitely lead to a bad film... I have names... But this film is the total opposite: it's simply a masterpiece. The storyline is excellent, the actors are amazing (McConaughey is amazing), they brilliantly play their part.  It's incredibly moving... please thing about having a Kleenex with you. It's the story of a man who would die to save his children, but as well for whom this life is not enough. His an explorer, an adventurer, a courageous man and a father. Put all this is your shaker and you get one of the most moving film I have ever watched.  .. to be watched.. and watched...."
2020.10.19,7,"You already know what's good about the movie, so let's look at the not so good: it's full of hamfisted plot points. Arguably, it starts off a fun causal loop which I tend to usually enjoy as plot devices. However it quickly devolves into to fairly poorly executed exposition tricks such as an engineer explaining to the pilot the very basics of the flight is just been selected for? Or the very basic of gravity that any astronaut would know about??? Why? You also have a scene in there where the lead takes down an Indian military predator drone with only two young children, a laptop and a Pringle cantenna. So it would be rather wise of the people qualify this as being highbrow 'hard' science fiction to eat a bit of humble pie, as a lot of the story is no more intelligent than than say, your average avengers movie. This isn't primer. Regardless, the direction and the photography are so brilliantly executed that it's impossible not to give this movie at least a seven * rating simply for the camera work and the vfx. It is not, however, the 2001 killer some rave about, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
2017.08.24,5,"Interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. It interests me. How can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? Is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws, or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboy-ism and bandwagon-ing? For starters, I would just like to say my opinion. I think the movie is fine. It's a little too drawn-out and has bizarre elements, and I think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film. Some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters, and for them, they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time. So, how did Nolan do it? Well, I believe he tapped into Zeitgeist, or the 'spirit of the times.' He made a perfect storm of a movie, using elements that, on their own are not very special, but combined, they reflect the values of this age. Let's break it down. First off: space. The works of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye have fired up new interest in space, and people loved the realistic take on the genre. Second: the message of love. Western Culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love, and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit. Layer on top of this the cinematography, direction, and style of Nolan, which fanboys have been eating up since Memento. And while I like almost all Nolan films, I think Interstellar is his worst, featuring Nolan-isms dialed up to 11, with philosophical stances on love, life, time, destiny, and humanity's position in the universe. Everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose, and there are reasons to like it. Just please, don't deny the fact that it's pretentious, overly long, and contrived. Recognize that but say that that didn't stop you from enjoying it."
2025.05.05,10,"🌌 10/10 - A Sci-Fi Masterpiece That'll Warp Your Soul 🚀 Interstellar isn't just a movie-it's an emotional black hole that pulls you in and refuses to let go. Nolan delivered a cinematic experience that's visually stunning, scientifically ambitious, and emotionally gut-wrenching all at once. The mix of hard science with deep human emotion hits different. From the silence of space to the ticking time-bomb of a planet where 1 hour equals 7 years, every moment feels urgent, massive, and beautifully tragic. Hans Zimmer's score? Literal chills. McConaughey's cry scene? Iconic. Murph's notebook? Legendary. And the ending-bittersweet, hopeful, and so Nolan. Whether you're in it for the space physics or the feels, this is one of those rare films that leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. Interstellar isn't just 10/10. It's time-bending, heart-breaking, genre-defining perfection. Must-watch, forever."
2021.05.30,10,"The very fact that this movie's representation of image of black hole aligns perfectly with the 1st true image of the same, tells you the lengths they went to make it, both in tecnically & cinematically."
2024.12.09,10,"To say this movie looks phenomenal is an understatement, to say I believe it's incredibly written is an understatement, to say that this movie is a masterpiece is too little to describe it. Interstellar is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It perfectly captivated exactly what I believe cinema should be. It's got spectacle, great stakes, amazing performances by all its actors, and most importantly at the center of it, heart, a beautiful, heartbreaking story of a father and daughter relationship at the very center of a movie filled with concepts that go beyond our comprehension. 'Love is the one thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space' This is one of the best lines I've heard in any movie ever. Interstellar plays with many things that we aren't able to comprehend and I think it does it very well. Being drawn to someone we do not see or touch but still feel the same love is something so deep that I probably would've never thought of before watching this movie. The one thing I thought I wasn't going to buy into before watching it for the first time was the 'they' I'd heard about when in the movie it's referred to higher dimensional beings, but I like the way it was done, still kind of left up to interpretation as to who 'they' are but I liked that, being able to evolve passed the current dimensions we are able to tap into was such a cool thing to see, I'll never not be fascinated by thought of time being a physical object somewhere out there. Wasn't fortunate enough to see it when it first came out in theaters for the first time. But I was grateful I got to see it in IMAX and wow. Christopher Nolan and his team have such a way of making you feel like you're there, entering atmospheres, going through this journey along with Cooper and the rest of the crew through wormholes and being out in space so far away from everything we know. A movie in space never felt more real to me than this. 'Because my dad promised me' It blew my mind to see that Murph's ghost was cooper all along, conveying the information from the black hole that was needed so that the remaining humans on earth could survive. The revelation of the Lazarus mission being a sham, that Dr. Brand never intended for the people on earth to be saved completely changed the way i felt about the movie. I was loving everything I was watching but I felt like that was an extra push that cooper already needed to keep the promise that one day we would be back to see his daughter. Unfortunately being gone for so long that he wasn't able to see her grow up like he would've wanted to, but keeping the promise that he would come back and Murph always believing he would was absolutely heartbreaking. I have not seen the Theory of Everything, so I can't get much into academy awards. But it's difficult for me to try and imagine a better performance by a leading actor than Matthew McConaughey in interstellar. Every actor was great but Matthew was phenomenal. To also speak on something I don't normally mention, the music. The score is absolutely remarkable, not for a second does it miss, at some points I couldn't hear the characters speak as clearly because of the loudness of the music, I've noticed that with other projects by Christopher Nolan but for me this I didn't care. This is up there with one of the best ever scored films. Hans Zimmer is a master at his craft. Edmund's Planet The fact that in the end brand was right, love was right. After her mistake in Miller's planet that caused them to lose over two decades of time I could understand the hesitation towards trusting her judgment. But the fact that she was the one in the right in the end is so depressing but meaningful. Love was the bridge for cooper to be able to communicate the information over to murph, and for brand's case it was also accurate because they would've been fine after all it they had gone to Edmund's planet in the first place. Love, a topic I normally find corny but it wasn't overplayed or anything, it worked to perfection and really leaves you thinking. I in my personal life was able to relate to feeling love, for people at far away distances, so it resonated just right and hit very hard. Interstellar, I may be a bit biased because it is my personal favorite movie of all time, but I don't care, that's something that will be very hard for any other movie to top for me, it even made me look forward to want to have a daughter of my own to teach, care and love for just as much someday. That's cinema, that's what movies should be about, make you feel something deep emotionally within you after watching, that's what this movie did for me and I hope everyone out there has the same feeling for some movie they hold close to their heart."
2025.03.11,10,"I have the highest expectation about this film because of the extremely positive ratings and reviews.... I never had that much expectation for a film before.... But still The film blew my mind. I never saw or even imagined anything like that......it isn't a movie it is a masterpiece in a century. I am so grateful that I was born in the right time where I'm able to watch this masterpiece. I don't need to write what happened in the movie, summary or why I'm so touched and lost in the move.. If you haven't, just watch it. I have already watched it many times. I didn't press the 5-second skip button on my keyboard for a single time-I remember that clearly. So please if you still haven't watched this movie...watch it. You will be grateful tooo. I don't know what I'm writing because I'm so lost in the depths of the movie.... I watch it on my pc. Though I regret not watching on a large screen but stil I'm grateful. Mentions: I would highly suggest you know at least a little about 4D, 5D, and time dimensions, as well as hypercube, tesseract, and of course time dilation. You should also know how gravity can work and communicate across all dimensions. I knew this before, so it is very enjoyable to me...So, if you didn't know about that, then just watch 1 or 2 videos about that."
2019.10.05,10,"I love how the music and the sound design give me immersion to the full history of Interstellar, I simply love it so much, great experience to watch."
2020.11.04,10,"Masterpiece. My favorite and best movie of all time. Story, plot and characters are best!!!"
2014.11.06,0,"Interstellar is massive in scope. Intellectually, and in vision. Space travel that pushes the limits of mankind's abilities. Jessica Chastain is great as she usually is.Matthew Mccaughnay (spelled terribly wrong) was a quite moving and motivated character.the desire he had to save his family but at the same time not forget his responsibility to humanity, was, for the lack of a better phrase, wonderfully noble. The ability to see beyond self is a quality sorely lacking in the real world we live in.Ann Hathaway s character too was believable.a reminder that love can move us to do amazing things no matter the cost. And also see the need to fulfill whatever is asked of us for the greater good.the scientific aspects of this movie will confuse some, it is beyond detailed.and since I'm not an astrophysicist or astronaut, I don't quite understand it all. However the plausibility of it all makes minds wonder and imagine great things about space travel. Lastly, the military a.i. that was used throughout the film was good.funny, personable, believable, and pretty awesome.everyone played their role and played it well.in my heart of hearts 10 out of 10.a film that will pull your heart strings"
2014.11.12,6,"Surprisingly weak effort by Nolan, who typically always nails his movies. The premises and outcomes all seem too silly and it is quite simply too long. Matthew McConaughey is miscast and often plays it quite melodramatic, especially early. I read one professional critic who wrote that he was the perfect 'stoner-cowboy' type to play the role. Really?! He's not the actor I'd choose to be the smartest engineer-pilot to save the human race with his brains. And (SPOILER) Matt Damon is a throwaway. Someone should have told him that was a sleeping pod, not an eating pod. Clearly, Nolan is fascinated with time-travel, but this is a weak effort compared to Inception and Memento. He's a good enough Director that it's still watchable, but it all feels so silly."
2025.05.20,10,"Interstellar is a movie about two things: An attempt to save mankind and also a pledge to return to your family. It's as gripping as it gets. Nolan wants to show us that no matter how hard you try in order to help others it's always the ones that you hold dearest that will feel most hurt if you don't get pull through. The movie is a gorgeous depiction of an unbelievable galaxy that feels understandable yet not present. It's also a movie about desperation, an attempt to save something that is doomed to fail and making that the absolute essence of work and dedication. Nolan has accomplished something special in both this movie and Inception (2010) - his usage and adaptation of time. Time is as key in the both movies but with different narratives. This movie speaks more about the choices we make, while Inception deals with a fundamental questioning concerning our perception of reality. It's a stellar performance, an incredible movie! Emotional and inspirational!"
2014.11.09,7,"I give this movie an A+ for effort, hence the 7 out of 10, but it ultimately fails. First of all this movie borrows so heavily from other movies of greater worth its almost, again, almost ludicrous. Second if you go watch 2001 you'll actually find interstellar's visuals a disappointment compared to a movie made almost 40 years ago. Sure they show a more accurate view of a worm hole and a black hole, but its glimpsed or seen through a cockpit window or on a computer screen. This movie does not embrace the visual of space as it claims to. Do we see what one of the planets that they are visiting looks like from space? uh no. Gravity did so much better at its visuals than this movie does. As you've probably heard the main story line is basically not original and a bit melodramatic. I had no connection to it. I was more interested in the people who had gone ahead of them, but we only meet one and he's unexpected and a jerk. (But in reality how much? Wasn't Cooper (matt m) being just as selfish in some ways??) Loved the music but so did the Director with his heavy handed use of it."
2016.04.08,5,"Despite good acting and wonderful special effects I'm still wondering why the characters need to find another planet to live on when they already have the magnificent Planet Earth?  When young LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District) students see this movie they actually think that if and when Planet Earth is destroyed that a space ship will be waiting to load all 9 billion earthlings, fly them through a wormhole and land them all safely on a new habitable planet. Some students even laugh at the thought of taking care of their home Planet Earth because it is disposable.  This is the sad message that this predictable, fast bucks movie presents to the next generation that will be the future caretakers of our one and ONLY Planet Earth."
2018.10.11,10,The best movie so far in my life.Thank you Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for this diamond.I'm hoping to create something like that soon
2021.05.28,10,This movie will always be in my soul. Ps. THE SOUNDTRACK IS ONE OF THE BEST.
2019.04.04,9,"I am not going to go into spoilers but just know that in the horde of uninspired and generic space movies, Interstellar shines brightly. It is a masterpiece of subversions and it just keeps on building and building its plot and raising the stakes higher with each second and it keeps you at the edge of your seat constantly as you are wondering how it will all end. One of the most satisfying movies that I have ever watched and it will blow your mind."
2024.12.10,10,"The production was amazing and very interesting, credit to the actors and actresses for their brilliant acting and for the production for the world class setting. Such an interesting movie to watch, a fast phase movie that targets the heart and soul of the audience and hope that it will reach beyond their target audience as it is really worth it to watch and enjoy such great movie. No dull moments and no boredom just pure enjoyment you eill experience by watching it. Either alone ir with companion you will surely not be bored, so I encourage everyone to experience what I experienced and see it for yourself."
2023.01.27,10,"Best movie of all time. I generally Don't write reviews, But this was beyond my imagination level. Each and every scene is presented in a perfect way with a great sense of acting, screenplay, and direction. This is one of the best movies I have ever watched The crazy journey to find a new home is filled with mind freezing adventures and crazy situations. I really appreciate the relationship value and love that's shown in the movie. Makes me cry whenever I see it. It's a complete package for everyone filled with Space, Time , Physics, Love and Family. Don't waste your time. GO watch it now!"
2015.11.19,10,"The theoretical physics involved were astounding. Don't know how else to describe it. The futuristic 'Dust Bowl.' The dictation of education. The dimensional transitions. It couldn't be any more logical.  Yes it's all 'Sci-Fi', but every scientific theory was considered 'Sci-Fi' at some point in time. This movie nails the scenario it portrays. This will probably remain as my favorite Matthew McConaughey movie forever. I have to say, it may beat Inception on my scale of favorites if any of the theoretical science comes to fruition. Inception is incredibly fictional, however not impossible and was, hands down, my favorite Sci-Fi movie ever. Interstellar is now in a shoving match with it between my top 2."
2017.02.19,0,"I don't go to the movies anymore because they've become out of my reach financially. So, while trying to decide what to stream one night, I saw that Interstellar had an 8.6 rating. I know that means nothing in and of itself, but a neighbors son told me it was fantastic. I was skeptical going in because anything that stretches the credulity of science too far doesn't interest me. No spoilers here. I'm just going to say what many have already said. This film is based on absurd premises and I had a hard time following the plot at times. I was hoping that something extraordinary would come along to save the film, but, as others have said, it gets worse as it goes on. When I saw Kubrick's 2001 at the theater when it came out, I was fascinated. This film looks like something thrown together in a hurry by Hollywood. I can't imagine a team of people agreeing that this finished product was ready for the screen."
2015.01.12,6,"Interstellar had some very interesting topics, for one that we're ruining our planet. It's probably the closest thing to reality in the entire movie, but it's worth taking at least that message. Interstellar reminded me of the grandeur shots of 2001: A Space Odyssey, music included. The power chords blew through the speakers in the cinema was quite deafening. But I can only say the cinematographically speaking, the movie is excellent. The only thing I miss here is some overview shot of the solar (or black hole) system they've entered, yet they make it up by at least letting you see a (limited) view of the planets they visit. Which brings me to the next topic, because if they would have spent less time on useless discussion, plot lines and just plane slow story development and more into the outline of the galaxy, the movie would probably by far better.  Yes, the slow story is very, very annoying and I frequently had the feeling: 'move along already!' The relativity of time was nicely put into view though I have question marks about some presentations of it. Eg. If I was a scientist I would visit the planet closest to the black hole as last. Since they lose years by the minute the consequences of something going wrong is far too high. The other two scientists could die, humanity could have been extinct, ... I also wander if the scientist on board of the Endurance would have kept his sanity during the long waiting time. Also they were pretty close to the remaining scientists and could have sent signals to keep contact. When they slingshot by the black hole Gargantua Cooper falls into the black hole and this is were I found the movie totally going off. Even if he would survive until he reached the event horizon from that point his body would literally be ripped apart. When he reaches the library I a had feeling of utter annoyance of how the story was developing. I must admit it was clever of the director on how they pass back and forth through time and how Cooper showed his daughter what to do, but the nagging annoying feeling didn't leave me and even came back when Cooper woke up on the space station that appears to be close to Saturn and which didn't make sense to me. Earth was seriously lacking resources so how were they able to create such a flourishing space station at that point in space and in less then 100 years (Cooper's daughter is about to die, so even if she reached a very old age, the time span between him leaving and the building of the space station is less than 10 decades.) An uplifting from other space movies must have been TARS and CASE. Not only have they got an original design, but I was silently expecting one of them to crash or behave erratically like in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Alien and that didn't happen. All in all Interstellar is not a bad movie, be it annoyingly slow at times."
2024.11.22,10,"Interstellar is, without a doubt, one of the most impressive sci-fi films I've seen in recent years. Christopher Nolan's direction, paired with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, creates a truly immersive experience. But what stands out the most is Matthew McConaughey's remarkable performance. His portrayal of Cooper, a father torn between saving humanity and being with his daughter, is incredibly moving. McConaughey brings such depth and emotion to the role, making every moment on screen resonate. The film's exploration of time, love, and sacrifice feels both epic and deeply personal, cementing Interstellar as a masterpiece in modern cinema."
2015.03.22,7,"I'm never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies – after all, similar to millions of other people I only watched a two-dimensional series of images under Persistence Of Vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. I wasn't actually 'there' or wanted to be either and I have no intention of reading Einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. I wouldn't even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a So What that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too. It's a 21st century cgi cartoon update on When Worlds Collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001, with a nod to Close Encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. Convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries, sorry, galaxies as the Earth or at least the American Midwest is slowly dying. It involves going through a Saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a Cosmic Pinball Wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to 'Us' by 'Them', whoever that lot were. Oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to inter-dimensional gobbledygook to ensure some people's eyes don't glaze over. A few points: Playing Love Is All Around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people; director Christopher Nolan used grizzled Michael Caine yet again, he must be a really big pal; Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky TARS & Co. on display as AI in here; on that bloody icy planet cool customer Matt Damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didn't expect to be ever opened up again; I ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers – I don't expect everyone, or anyone for that matter to be up to Laurence Olivier's standard of diction but we're not all Kings Of Leon fans; somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! The money shots for me were the emotional and fraught Lander craft re-docking with the Endurance scenes, however it was taken so slowly I thought for a while Anne Hathaway had fainted. The cartoonery is routinely spectacular, at eye-cutting edge. Basically: as with Inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er well-grounded but unwary viewer; get over it and it's entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt – I switched on, switched off and enjoyed it. Way too long though, it seemed to last decades."
2014.11.17,3,"The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because... YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that. That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up. During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence. Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals."
2019.08.17,10,By far one of the greatest films!I urge you to see for yourself
2022.07.14,10,"Everyone will have their own take on this film but for me the message is that a great Dad will do anything to protect his family. Whether it involves diving into the darkness without a safety net or traversing the boundaries of time and space, its all in the job description. And as corny as that may sound, its true. I absolutely love this film, even with its quirks."
2021.01.30,10,This the most close definition of perfection. I can till this movie is a masterpiece by the meaning of the word.
2021.05.06,10,Watch this movie with no expectations or even without watching the trailer. Sound tract alone is noteworthy.
2020.09.10,10,"Mindblowing ! My go to movie, it may have even pipped my all time favourite to the post which is One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. The musical score is stunning, the cinematography is spellbinding and the who concept it beautiful. The more times you watch it the deeper you get pulled in just like Gargantua. This movie is very special to me. I love it"
2021.08.12,10,"This movie was so, but so good, it was my favorite of all the time, it opened my mind so bad, im not being able to sleep, its just so good, i have no words, I just hope that everyone feels the feeling im having rn, cuz its amazing."
2018.03.04,0,INTERSTELLAR is emotional and well acted but lacking substance: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS FILM WAS ABOUT! Space travel? Interdimensional travel? It's also bleak. 'Contact' (1997) was a similar but much better. Christopher Nolan's best film was 'Insomnia' (2002); 'Batman Begins' (2005) wasn't bad either. 'Inception' (2010) was another Christopher Nolan film I didn't think much of (turned it off) because like Interstellar I'm not sure what it was about; so much going on on the surface; so complex and sophisticated but also empty and convoluted. 4/10.
2015.10.26,6,"It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a 'pretty good' film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent."
2019.05.05,10,I really liked this film and the music in this film.
2015.02.13,6,"I think that the film was an ordinary sci-fi movie not more. The emphasize on Social aspects of human and magical role of love seems just a repeated slogan. The reasoning was completely naive and it's was very cliché. Even the dram and tragedies of the film was childish. In term of story and content I didn't like it overall but there were some nice contradictions in the story esp in the beginning, the sentimental scenes between Matthew and his daughter and also there were some good surprise, however very cliché in sci-fi, at the end of story.  I term of visual aspect, this is a good film. I didn't like the story part but this part was good. There were some shots which was crazy.  If you like to see a good, well-written film, even sci-fi, and the story,fantasy and creativity is important to you this movie isn't satisfactory I think."
2018.03.26,1,"I found this pretentious crap. After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. '2001'' the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish."
2019.10.05,10,"By this point, Christopher Nolan became synonymous with thought provoking films l...and adding to his well established filmography is this brilliant magnum opus... beautifully concieved by the minds of Chris Nolan, his brother Jonathan Nolan and astrophysicist Kip Thorne, the science portrayed in this film (by this time proven to be plausible) along with the father daughter relationship combines to form a visual spectacle unlike any other... Highly recommend to watch it..."
2020.11.11,10,"Its been over 6 years since I see this movie and I had to re-watch it again (for the 4th time) to transport myself to a truly amazing outer world experience. The Nolan brothers wrote this masterpiece and Christopher Nolan directed - what amazing minds! This Sci-fi movie had everything I want and more in a movie.... action, love, intelligence, A-Class acting and space exploration. I adore every part of this film and the AI robots that follow the characters about in the film add a wonderful touch. This movie blew my mind back then and it still does now."
2015.12.12,8,"Interstellar is one of those sci-fi that demands your attention throughout the film.If you are hoping for action like The dark Knight or Inception ,you would surely be disappointed. For me it is more like feeling the movie rather than just watching it.Matthew McCaughey nailed it this time. The only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.The plot has so many holes that you can't help but notice.Anne Hathaway's one dialogue ruin its ending.'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space'.Seriously? I mean if you want to take liberty in Black hole's quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.Anyway, overall its a fantastic movie ,after all its a Nolan movie. So overall I have to say this is a must watch movie in fact one of the best movies of the decade."
2020.11.05,9,"Must See movie. One of Nolan's Epic. Story moves Fast, With Emotion and stunning Cinematography and Sceenplay. Most of All Zimmer's Amazing Score which will make u cry . It is one of best space exploration movie ranking Atleast within top 3. 100 percent Worth Watching."
2022.06.20,9,"I will start of this by saying the negatives, which their are few of. The story can at times be a bit off-putting, or even confusing if your not giving full attention. Especially the end which I personally liked alot, but It is a bit odd what happened, and I can see it not making alot of sense for people. The acting is mostly solid but there's a couple actors in here which aren't the best, mainly John Lithgow which he does fine but not good, a few of the side characters, and child actors (though ofc it's not their fault). The shots can occasionally be odd, in how some shots feel too far away to how I think it should be, even though mostly the cinematography is solid. Only the positives. The music in this film is not only brilliant on its own, it is so well put into the film to fit however it's supposed to be used; much more elegant ways then most films. The music is probably my favorite movie soundtrack at the moment too. The cinematography is great at almost all times, the shots on the sides of the ship I think are really cool, alot of shots spin with them, there was a shot that was intentionally blurry in here to fit the mood, and the camera shakes when it's appropriate and is usually still when not. As well I feel the more intense shots are done wonderfully, following very well if needed. Acting performance from Matthew McConaughey I think might be his best performance, which says alot, as well the performance from Anne Hathaway is really great here, and some of her best work. And this is definitely Jessica Chastains best work I've seen. Matt Damon as usual does excellent. And Michael Caine also does pretty alright, even though he feels pretty emotionless for alot of the movie, but also kinda mysterious, which can fit that character. John Lithgow does fine, good for him though, and I like how he did, just not too great. And I could name all the actors but really for the most part they are all good. The sets on this film and effects are top notch. I've heard a lot of the space scenes; namely the one coming out of the wormhole took up to 100 hours to render each frame which definitely shows. The space shots are beautifully detailed, and the sets on earth are great because they actually grew a cornfield. The story of this film is also great, and is executed very well. It's told like alot of Nolan movies though (memento, Dunkirk) where mysteries are introduced throughout, and explained later, and the story is kinda told in reverse to traditional stories. But the story makes perfect sense, up until the very end which I think does, but is debatable. And feels really smart, and scientific. Using actual science to explain alot of this stuff, and properly doing so. I love all the little details they added here too, like every tick on millers planet was one day, that kinda stuff is really cool, doesn't make it much better but just interesting. Which this movie has tons of! Over all I feel it's a 9.2 Spoiler portion real quick for this end People don't like the end but it feels very right to me, it makes sense in the plot, and is explained fine, but definitely seems a bit unlikely. But feels like a good ending, everything is wrapped up nicely with a bow, and not in a all good way, but just a very nice ending. Not all is made up for at the end either. He's still missed atleast 80 years on earth. While it failed. But my only problem with it is how did they colonize so fast? Still a good ending, and I also like where they imply goes with brands story but never shown."
2015.11.19,10,"Intersteller opens at an unspecified future date in America's farm belt. Although the film is careful not to identify a year, it's probably around 2050. The world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. With nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. Former NASA engineer and test pilot Cooper owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family: son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald. Drawn by almost supernatural means to a chain-link fence around a super-secret location, Cooper finds himself face-to-face with what remains of his former employer: an underground think- tank dedicated to saving the human race. Led by Professor Brand, NASA has developed two plans. The first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. The second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. There are problems with Plan A - namely, overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship - but Brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible. This is the movie that shows how the world will end due to human activity that caused and how the human tries to explore the galaxy to find a new home for humanity."
2015.02.01,6,"Tooo long Tooo much like 2001 Add a bit of event Horizon Dark star Black hole Armageddon Space 1999 Star trekking.... The one. With god  All that was missing was Bruce Willis and batman, sorry Alfred did appeared  Enjoyed it trough far to many plagiarism's Expected something better than space, that was really dull Gravity wasn't strong enough Lost in space was more dynamic and scientifically more inaccurate HAL2000 unit. Robbie the robot was missing. Needed a Panama airplane somewhere Kubrick did film The Apollo Moon landings Where was room 237?"
2022.07.08,10,After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.
2020.09.08,7,"I had heard a LOT about this film, and how people had to watch it several times to fully grasp its complexity. I came to the film with tons of expectations but it was kind of a letdown. Half baked characters, especially the women. I am not qualified to question the science, so not getting into that at all. What I can say is that the motivations of characters are extremely sketchy. Emotions are not Nolan's forte. The scenes in which characters wax poetic about love are just bad."
2014.11.10,1,"His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover."
2022.02.15,8,"Entertaining. Consistent. Space-travel at high stakes. It's hard-SF. Plays with the rules of physics. Good story, great acting, great music. The movie has it's own atmosphere, look and feel. A must-see. Anyway, it's now a classic of SF, that brought a lot to this genre."
2020.10.31,9,I have already lost count of the times I have seen this movie and I am still fascinated by the beautiful soundtrack and the immensity of each frame
2024.12.24,10,"I enjoyed thought-provoking science fiction that combines stunning visuals with a deep emotional narrative which this movie has shown. So, I highly recommended Interstellar. It's an epic journey that leaves a lasting impact and sparks contemplation long after the movie ends. It's a film that not only challenges our understanding of space, time, and relativity but also delves into human connection and perseverance. While the complex scientific concepts may be difficult for some viewers, the emotional core of the story is universally relatable. It's a cinematic experience that goes beyond traditional science fiction to explore the very nature of existence, love, and the future of mankind. With its stunning visuals, haunting soundtrack."
2025.02.20,9,"Back in 2014 when only few selected cities in India had the privilege of IMAX screens, in order to watch this film in a regular theatre, I had to take a train journey to another state. And I did it twice. Now after 10 years, finally I got chance to watch this sci-fi epic as it is meant to be i.e., in an IMAX screen. The cinematic experience was unbelievable right from the beginning till the end credits. Even Avatar didn't had such an impact the way this Nolan's masterpiece has while viewing on the big screen. Be it the cast, storytelling, cinematography or background score, this sci-fi masterpiece has every ingredient that will leave you in awe when the credits roll. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper is superb in his role of an ex-NASA pilot turned farmer in a dystopian future where the Earth has become uninhabitable. Cooper's chemistry with his daughter Murph is heartwarming that will leave you in tears on multiple occasions. This is something new from Nolan who in his previous creations never really fixated his characters in such emotional things. Music by Zimmer is on another level and makes every scene a memorable one especially the Cornfield Chase, the Docking Sequence and that timer on the Miller's Plant. Even writing about these gives me chills. Not to mention the detailing of every scientific term to make it easy for audience to understand the concept is something that needs to be acknowledged. The amount of time Nolan invested with the likes of Nobel award winning scientist Dr. Kip Thorne to make this movie so close to realism is something that has never been done before. Planning to watch every time it is re-released."
2018.09.08,10,"I'm slowly losing count of how many times I've seen this movie. It was.....filled with pure emotion. It feels real because this could happen to Earth one day, considering we're not making too much progress on protecting it and it might just turn on us one day. The acting is brilliant, the dialogues are well thought through, the visuals are beyond stunning and LOVE GOES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME. There wasn't a time where this movie didn't make me cry. Even if I know what will happen I simply can't help it. It's just one of those movies. It leaves me in a totally another dimension. Even if you don't like sci-fi this movie cannot leave you emotionless. I can confidently say this is my favourite, and I've watched a lot of movies. A masterpiece. Thank you Nolan, thank you for this."
2025.05.08,10,"This might be the greatest film of all time. Bar none. No hyperbole. It takes one of the greatest fears of all humankind and brings the audience on an adventure of impossibility, to the darkest corners of unexplored space, where only quantum physicists have theorized, and made it a movie. Matthew McConaughey is not known for his serious roles, or at least not many. He will forever be remembered for this movie: as a father searching for a home, as a human looking for an answer, and an earthling venturing through deep space. Even if the story wasn't good enough, this movie also included two incredible quantum space locations that have only been theorized, but never visited. People are writing scientific papers based on the renderings and science of this movie! Christopher Nolan deserved an Oscar for this movie, as well as a Noble prize for the physics he included in it."
2014.11.23,0,"Visually, Interstellar is exceptional and brilliantly rendered. The plot is centered on a attempt of poignant savior of humanity against global warming that has made the earth uninhabitable by the behavior of those in the 20th century. Yet only the United States is reflected and it is well known American's live differently than many other smaller or say 3rd world countries. Shouldn't we at least take a glimpse at what they turned out like before shooting off? Or did we forcibly take over every other country and ruin it all? As you can see it's already not making full sense. The human race is in jeopardy so obviously we must look too Matthew McConaughey and his character Cooper to save the day, uh, world population. Cooper is your run of the mill ex pilot, engineer, and obviously single parent forced by the government no less to run a farm. That's right a farm , where all the most brilliant people of your country should be hiding. He is then pulled off his farm and told to pilot a bunch of non credible i.e also non-believable scientists that include the likes of Anne Hathaway and Wes Bentley to go find a planet suitable for human life. With all the talk of humanity and the first hour going on about the downfall of humanity on earth there is little humanity in the characters. An ongoing weakness of Nolan's work is constantly relying on effects and name actors to flitter around the screen as one dimensional people and little substance to hold on to. It's fairly hokey and riddled with epic nonsense. Now if this was a small indie film, I would be much more lenient and applause the attempt but considering the budget and scale of production with access to anything and everything money can buy and all the time , locations, and experts in the world at their disposal it would be crazy to let it pass. The visuals are top notch but there is really no excuse for such a lazy, one dimensional film, that lacks so much sense when every aspect a filmmaker could possibly desire was at their feet. It seemed like mind numbing visuals just thrown out to the public as if we would be too simple to notice there's nothing really to it. I much rather watch a carefully crafted no budget film where I feel the filmmakers heart and soul and probably a whole lot of tears poured into every possibly imperfect but purposeful scene than see how far our technology has gone but how digressive our minds have. There is one thing for sure other than the spectacular visuals is if this is the intellect we will hold steady to, we likely will ruin our planet. While I like McConaughey and think has really proved himself a top notch actor in recent years this film did him no favors and certainly was not needed to hold such a title."
2014.11.10,6,"The beginning is awesome. Matthew McConaughey establishes himself in what could be one of his greatest roles. The themes of the movie are powerful, covering our inability to forecast/compensate for a changing ecosystem coupled with our stubborn refusal to fund great endeavors like NASA. We do need to get off this planet and that's about where the movie ends for me. Because they're stealing from the Inception/Transcendence genre, we start seeing plot devices for the sake of plot devices, some of which make no sense. This wormhole for instance. Or the tesseract. If humanity doesn't survive Earth, how does it retroactively create the impressive and nearly impossible things they're going to save humanity with. It's the kind of paradox that movie-goers pay good money for and leave good reviews, but it's ultimately garbage. What also got me was the reused tropes. 2 main characters and an extra on a mission. Does this guy die or go crazy? Die. Check, next one goes crazy. Check. And that ending...the whole 'if you want it bad enough, things will turn out good' bit. Nothing to do with saving yourself."
2025.04.05,10,"Interstellar is a breathtaking masterpiece that masterfully blends science fiction with deep human emotion. Christopher Nolan delivers a visually stunning and intellectually rich film that explores time, love, and survival. Hans Zimmer's powerful score enhances every moment, while Matthew McConaughey gives a career-defining performance. The film's portrayal of space travel is both realistic and awe-inspiring. It challenges the mind and touches the heart, leaving a lasting impression. Interstellar isn't just a movie-it's an experience. A true 10/10 in every possible way. In my opinion: The greatest movie of all time."
2014.11.07,7,"The epic feel of 'Interstellar' comes from its sheer length and scope of events, but the actual impact of the plot line was lacking, leaving me STILL unsure as to whether or not I even liked the movie. It feels like this is a film that the Nolan brothers wanted to make without creative input from the evil movie executives who usually demand edits based on pacing or story/character complexity. In short, it's a director's cut, through and through. Some scenes or plot points were light or jumbled that I stopped trying to figure out what was going on and just let the movie take me for a ride, in which I became more of a spectator than a moviegoer. The development of the movie itself felt a little like ADHD Netflix; first it's Shyamalan's Signs, then 2001: A Space Odyssey, suddenly Event Horizon (softened by the deadpan humor of Dr. Who-esque robots), ending with Luke Skywalker hopping in a small spacecraft with his trusty droid off to find Leia in the Degoba System or whatever. Though 'Interstellar' brings some new story mechanisms into play, like Einstein's relativity and what it would be like to exist outside of time, these devices have been explored thoroughly outside of film - unlike the 'dream within a dream' concept. At the end of the day, the spectacular feel of 'Interstellar' is handicapped by it's lack of solid delivery and plot disconnectivity. It's worth the price of a normal movie ticket, but don't be surprised if you leave the theater scratching your head."
2015.12.12,1,"I resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism, its artistic laziness & its technical sloppiness. I resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. By virtue of its sheer popularity on IMDb it's a testament to the colossal, continuing dumbing down of movie audiences. Where to start on specifics? The premise of a world-wide drought (a major blooper mentioned on this site) with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. Okra grown as a major food crop (or was that supposed to be a joke)? Cut & paste interviews from a Ken Burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. The tiresome cheapie 'homages' to Kubrick's 2001. The pedantic Astrophysics for Dummies lectures.The soap opera characters. The one dimensional acting. The utter predictability of every single plot twist. I'd get more specific, but then I'd be blacklisted for including spoilers.  You want to see imaginative mind-blowing science-fiction/fantasy film making? Let me make 2 suggestions: Stalker and Solaris. Both Russian films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Far lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar.  In summary the sheer numbing dullness & stupidity of Interstellar (& its concomitant popularity) managed to knock me into the worst state of depression I've experienced from a movie in years."
2024.12.15,10,"Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a cinematic triumph. Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score elevates the film, blending emotion and grandeur seamlessly. The story is a thought-provoking exploration of love, sacrifice, and humanity's survival, rooted in grounded science and boundless imagination. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway deliver powerful, heartfelt performances, complemented by stunning cinematography that captures both cosmic vastness and human intimacy. It's a rare fusion of intellect and emotion that lingers long after the credits roll. A timeless epic. I bow down to everyone from the team."
2021.02.28,9,"I'll spare the usual details given that 4000 others have covered the story of Interstellar. Rather, I'd like to say that once again I am truly baffled. Baffled at how every film the Nolan boys come together to write and direct, using the genius of Hans Zimmer to score their work, manages to evoke such emotion and captivate me to the very end. Despite the bitterness I have after seeing what Hans would do to the Lion King in Disney's live-action remake, I simply cannot ignore how unbelievably adept he is at his job. I decided to revisit this film after several years and found myself in tears by the end when Cooper and Murph finally reunite. And while the story itself surely had much to do with my reaction, I cannot ignore the role Hans' compositions played from opening credits on to the very end. I felt that final moment in my chest, as the two of them spent only a minute to acknowledge the journey both had taken. Am going to go out on a limb here and say that without this specific composer the film would have been very, very different. And Nolan seems to know just this. The partnership seemingly continues to sharpen their skills with each production. It's something I am in awe of as I watch the likes of Interstellar, Inception, The Dark Knight, and Dunkirk. An amazing sci-fi film with an original story to tell (rare nowadays) which you surely don't want to miss out on. This is one of those titles that I would put in the 'Must Watch' pile as mandatory for everyone."
2015.11.23,10,A remarkable story of searching for footprints on a different surface...a story to remind us of the duty we have as earthlings and how things can quickly fall to pieces. A tale about the things parents will sacrifice in order for their children to fulfill their destinies and how that bond between them will always exist. One man's vision turns into another man's ability to pursue that goal at whatever cost to him. The harsh reality that time waits for no man and that no one can ever predict the future without suffering some sort of rejection for the present.
2025.02.09,10,"A friend of mine suggested me that movie coz I told him that I love science. I was expecting something silly with aliens. Well, I couldn't be so wrong and I'm very glad for that. After they reached Saturn, I literally saw the movie with my mouth open. I've seen it so many times and I can't get enough of this masterpiece. I don't know where to start. Acting? Soundtracks? Plot? Everything just 10 out of 10. Nolan made his miracle with that movie. Thankfuly it doesn't have a sequel because it would ruin the essence of that movie. For someone who isn't familiar with physics and astronomy, it may be difficult to understand, but if you dig into the science of interstellar, it's not that difficult to understand it!"
2021.04.03,10,"This movie is the perfect example of what cinema can and should be. This is probably the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The composition of the shots, a great soundtrack, characters that you will immediately connect to. This film is beautifully balanced and left me with a moved but very satisfied feeling. This is a movie you will not forget."
2022.07.12,10,"First time I saw it was back in 2014 in Imax and it was hands down the best film I have ever seen in theaters. I went into it thinking it would probably bore me and it ended up being one of my all time favorite movies. The acting, score, visual effects and writing are outstanding. I would highly recommend giving this film a watch if you haven't already."
2014.11.18,0,"This movie is terrible on so many levels... good graphics... AMAZING GRAHICS... but the film made me want to gag so often... Not just the new age misinterpretation of quantum physics, and the non-sense of the power of love... and the paradoxical time loop that would mean he created his own destiny by tinkering with the past But moreover, the whole premise of a unfixable world where the only hope is to create space habitats to save people... Seriously folks, if all the food sources are being destroyed by a fungus, it will be pretty much impossible to get into space without bringing that fungus with them. Furthermore, if they have the technology to create a space habitat... they have the technology to fix this planet or at the very least to make habitable space on earth... so why not fix the world we have (or build biospheres) instead of wasting all that money and time and scientific brilliance on building a space habitat!!!"
2015.02.17,6,"It's not really a good Sci-fi, you take away the wormhole and replace the setting with WW2 Japan, where a father has to go on a suicide mission and there you have it. Melodramatic and not really reflective of humanity as a whole, or our place in the Universe. The film contemplates nothing significant and manages to tell nothing. Basically a cheap tearjerker for USA audience, cashing in on dwindling patriotism. Protip: if you want good Sci-Fi films try either Sunshine or Pandorum. They are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right. Or heck even Solaris if you're really that into melodrama.  I'm really disappointed in Nolan, after confused and often mind-twisting films like Inception and The Prestige, Nolan seems to be transforming into another side of Michael Bay where all Those millions are more important than integrity."
2022.02.13,10,"I think this is Christopher Nolan's best film. Btw I haven't watched all, but this is very close to me. I can recommend to every generation. You don't have to like sci-fi or something like that. I think everyone can love this masterpiece. Good choice for a long night."
2014.12.09,6,"OK, I get it ! It's a Nolan movie so everyone hu-ha about it. Well actually no, I do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the message board. While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times.  This movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama just doesn't ever stop. The movie is too long.  Maybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90, it would have been great !"
2014.12.13,2,"How this travesty of a 'sci-fi' movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great 'sci-fi' flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer.  Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you 'hire' a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for 'strange new worlds'. He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like 'Gravity', another recent 'sci-fi' disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a 'Gen 12' Robbie the Robot.  Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic 'sci-fi' film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the 'spoiler' clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work.  I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic 'sci-fi' movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien."
2020.11.01,10,"This movie literally changed my life to before and after. Sometimes I really want to reapaet the moment I was watching this film to feel the emotions again. What a greatness, what a plot!! This is what cinematography should be about!! A must watch!!"
2020.11.27,10,"One of the best movies ever made. It is absolutely mind-boggling and even though you don't understand a squat the first time watching it, it still amazes you. I've watched this at least 10 times and it never gets old. I just love it."
2024.12.09,10,"As a military chaplain, I found 'Interstellar' (2014) thought-provoking and spiritually enriching. Director Christopher Nolan's masterpiece explores humanity's quest for survival, love, and transcendence. The film's themes resonate deeply with my experiences ministering to Filipino soldiers facing life-and-death situations. # The Search for Hope The movie's narrative, driven by Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) journey through wormholes, echoes the Filipino value of 'pag-asa' (hope). Amidst uncertainty, Cooper's love for Murph (Jessica Chastain) inspires him to push beyond the boundaries of space and time. This selfless love mirrors the sacrifices our soldiers make for their families and country. # Time, Space, and Divine Providence The film's exploration of time dilation and gravitational forces parallels the mysteries of divine providence. As Cooper navigates the vast expanse, he encounters moments of serendipity and synchronicity. These moments evoke the Filipino concept of 'kapalaran' (destiny), reminding us that our lives are intertwined with a higher power. # Human Resilience and Sacrifice 'Interstellar' highlights humanity's capacity for resilience and sacrifice. The astronauts' bravery and willingness to risk everything for the greater good resonate with the Filipino military's values of courage and selflessness. The film serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices our soldiers make to protect our nation. # A Cosmic Perspective on Faith 'Interstellar' encourages viewers to contemplate the intersection of science, faith, and humanity. As a chaplain, I see parallels between Cooper's journey and the spiritual quest for meaning. The film inspires reflection on our place within the universe and the transcendent forces that guide us. 'Interstellar' is a powerful exploration of human existence, love, and the mysteries that lie beyond."
2022.02.03,10,"The best movie i have ever watched , the shots , the story is absolutely mind blowing , emotional & majestic , Hats off to the team and actors , I loved the cast its perfectly perfect for this epic movie ."
2024.12.08,10,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a sweeping epic exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and humanity's enduring quest for survival. Set in a near-future Earth ravaged by blight and dust storms, the film follows a group of astronauts undertaking a perilous journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. While the complex scientific concepts might initially seem daunting, Nolan masterfully weaves them into a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The film's narrative strength lies in its compelling characters. Matthew McConaughey delivers a powerful performance as Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, grappling with the responsibility of leaving his children behind to embark on a mission that may never return him. His unwavering love for his daughter Murph, played with remarkable depth by Mackenzie Foy (young Murph) and Jessica Chastain (adult Murph), forms the emotional core of the film. The bond between father and daughter transcends time and space, serving as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of familial connections. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Amelia Brand, a brilliant astrophysicist, adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, showcasing both scientific prowess and emotional vulnerability."
2022.07.11,10,"Wow. I have no words ro explain what I felt when I watched this movie for the 1st time. I can only say: wow. It has a story that I can't telle here cause ONLY the movie can. You feel happy, then you feel sad, and then angry, then mad and it just blows your mind! Totally recomend! 10/10."
2015.01.25,0,"OK. I understand that the Nolan brothers have a fan base because of the Batman movies or whatever but there is no way in Hell this is among the best movies of all time. First of all it is lengthy without variety (thus boring), and unnecessary melodramatic. The last 20' (out of 170') where the resolution of any 'mystery' is residing are somehow rewarding but the movie tires its audience long before that. I would like to compare it with Carl Sagan's (check my avatar) Contact (1997) which more than 15 years earlier managed to make a movie faaaar more interesting, and with deeper meanings. The Nolan brothers only went for cheap father(s)/daughter(s) dramas, just to embellish some scientific theories that may or may not be true after all. You see... Despite the facts that this movie advertised as 'more truthful to the current scientific theories, it is pure fiction whatsoever. Overall: If you are a fan of the genre you most definitely will check it out no matter what, so...."
2014.11.08,7,"Having looked at many of the earlier reviews I was staggered at much of their orgasmic nature. This film is good, and well worth a visit to the cinema to see it. The imagery is excellent as we have come to expect from Christopher Nolan. The acting is OK but not Oscar winning - in fact some of Matthew McConaughey and his Texan drawl does get a bit tiresome by the end. The story itself inspires much thought, but not in the same way as Inception - that is quite a good thing really as your brain doesn't have to work quite as hard to keep up. Seriously it is an OK film and a good watch, albeit a tad too long - but the last 20 minutes is weird, a little rushed, and could easily be dropped. Don't let my comments in any way put you off seeing the movie, but please don't expect 10 out of 10 unless you are very easily pleased."
2022.03.01,10,Taking it from this angel of view and the pure science added value I liked the cast and the perspective of direction that showed the conflict between his choices before and after knowing the truth .... it was amazing to watch this movie.
2024.03.18,7,"A good science fiction film, but in my humble opinion it doesn't deserve this rain of 10/10 that I see on imdb and an 8.7 overall. Maybe with the big rating, I had too high expectations. The plot is good, the actors are good. The music is very good too, I even had the impression that it carried the film to a certain point. The planets visited were a bit disappointing, I wish there was more to it than that. In all the infinity and unknown of space, there is no limit to the imagination and frankly, there hasn't been much. Movie was a little long at times, and the end, you kinda could see it coming. Theories about gravity were often weird. The rebellious father who doesn't care about the teachers' opinions when it comes to his son irritated me a little. I found him immature. I found that people didn't care a bit when other people of team died. ''Ah he's dead, dammit! Oh well, let's continue... It seems like we had more empathy for robots. The robots were still cool though. I found that there were a few easy jokes and a light atmosphere in difficult moments and it was a bit unrealistic. As much as the film was long, the beginning was very fast, almost too fast, with the random father who overnight becomes a potential hero to save the planet. At the end, it felt a bit like I was watching a weird Outer Limit scenario. It becomes a little cheesy, sometimes a little tryhard without really providing anything credible. I see 'best movies ever' everywhere, I find it exaggerated. It was a good film, which entertained me. A good 7/10 for me, I recommend."
2014.11.18,2,"You know those special movies that leave you with something more than you had before you watched them? They enrich you, teach you, show you. This isn't one of those.  Interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in Nolan's mind, falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script. The script isn't the only problem with all of it's hammy hokum and lack of character. Even the heralded special effects are so cliché at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas.  Here is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, 'I could make an adventure movie about that.' Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't. I watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. Trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion. As cynical as it sounds, after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage, I question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm."
2022.02.15,10,"After entering the black hole and getting stuck in multidimensional space, Cooper realized that gravity passes through the dimensions and can use it to send information about the black hole, but before that it was the force of love that made Murphy return to her room and Look at the wrist watch."
2021.05.22,10,I can't start to name all the things that i feel while watching this movie. The soundtrack is absolutelety moving. I felt a different person when the movie ended.
2022.06.24,10,"An emotive, exceptional and original film that makes us learn a lot about physics and it inspires us to become a potential astronaut though ! It was a pleasant film to watch, that you have cling to it though ! Even if it's a long film, everything is important, interesting and full of actions ! I definitely appreciated seeing that film and I DO recommend you to watch it !"
2022.06.20,10,This movie hit me on so many levels. This is one of the only movies I have actually shed a tear to. The time difference part just makes you feel some sort of way.
2020.11.08,10,"I am a huge Sci-Fi fan, Star Wars being my favourite film ever until I saw Interstellar! The first time I saw it, I was blown away! I love the science involved in this movie, excellent cast and original story. I have since watched this film a dozen times and it is every bit as good as the first time."
2014.11.10,7,"This movie is not his masterpiece. I actually like Nolan's movies such as Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight Trilogy. But this movie is too long and dragging it seems like waste of film to make a movie this long. Why input lots of useless dialogue or scenes? The only part I like is actually the part they're not in space, as the effect on space is not really good and gets a little boring overtime. If I want to watch a movie with space, I prefer and suggest to watch Cosmos: A Space TimeOdyssey (2014), it have more awesome visual stunning effects than this movie and also more clever approach for your brain because it teaches you REAL science.  Maybe Nolan is not ready to make a Space Movie. If you think this is the best space movie of all time, I suggest you watch the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). I prefer Hal 9000 over Tars for an AI."
2015.11.22,10,".. since this isn't really a film, it's a psychedelic experience, a journey to parallel dimensions; we slip through the wormhole of imagination into the place where we always were, but forgot to be. Love, it's a lot of love, hope and whatever it takes to conquer despair and the looming end of humanity. Wow, tears and intensity, all the way through to the other side. I am compelled to write more, but what can I say, it's all in the film, go see it. Whatever you do, watch this film with those you love. It will stay with me for a long time to come, I believe. Now off to dream world and who knows where that will take me, is Brand waiting for me?"
2015.04.02,6,"Unlike, say, Michael Bay, Christopher Nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. It's an admirable trait, and the results certainly speak for themselves. Unfortunately with 'Interstellar' his grasp on that rung is often tenuous, and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war. Technically the film is brilliant. The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. The cast do what they can, but there's just nothing here for them to gain purchase, and as a result I experienced a total emotional detachment throughout."
2014.11.09,1,"A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil. Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through.  Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself. The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service).  I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.) For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about 'saving humanity' but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have... But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar. The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, 'It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.' Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness.  The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so. In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started. Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of 'who wants to be a millionaire?' Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography. For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup.  The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending. Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more."
2015.12.10,8,"Great movie. The beginning is interesting, as we learn that they are in some future year, and there is lack of food, etc. I liked that part, of introducing the viewer to the future Earth. The worst thing is that it may actually be accurate. The movie has beautiful pictures but the first half gets a little boring, nothing really happens. However, that changes in the second half, as the team travels through space. Things start happening and emotions start appearing, as well as suspense. There are good dialogues between the crew and those talks between astronauts and their families are really touching. However, in the last third of the movie, it really gets astonishing. The part of Matt Damon's planet is exciting and from there it goes all the way up. It reaches its climax when the rocket is drawn to the black hole and all the process gets explained. It is a mind twisting movie with a great final. Also, the soundtrack is really amazing, which is easy to explain: Hans Zimmer. Matthew Mcconaughey has a great performance and for me it's one of the movies of the year."
2024.12.14,10,"'Movies are meant to be watched on the big screen' is a saying I disagree with. Most of the time, I prefer my home setup. My 4K TV usually provides better visuals, and my headphones actually let me hear what the actors are saying, instead of the dialogue being a bassy garble. The best part, I don't have to deal with inconsiderate people talking during the movie or lighting up my peripheral vision with their phones. That said, I do make the exception for IMAX. No home theater setup can replicate the sheer immersive experience of watching a film shot on IMAX cameras, in the format it was designed for. Interstellar is the best movie ever made for IMAX. I recently saw Interstellar in IMAX for its 10th anniversary. It was my second time experiencing it in IMAX, the first being its original release. Back then, I sat in the front row and didn't fully appreciate the movie or the format. This time, I was blown away. My God! Interstellar doesn't just play on the screen; it engulfs you. The breathtaking visuals and bone-rattling sound design make it an unparalleled cinematic experience. Forget gimmicks like DBOX-IMAX's sound engineering alone makes you feel every vibration and shake of the spacecraft. The vastness of space, the colossal scale of planets, and the beauty of the black hole-is breathtaking on the ginormous screen. The docking sequence, paired with Hans Zimmer's No Time for Caution, is pure cinematic magic. The soaring organ, the pounding bass, and the visceral sense of motion-it's not just a scene; it's a full-body experience. It's one of the most unforgettable moments I've ever had as a movie fan. While IMAX undoubtedly enhances the experience, it's not the main reason the movie is so great. Interstellar is a masterpiece on its own. Its story is original, emotional, and inspiring. The acting is exceptional, with heartfelt performances that ground the film's bold sci-fi premise. The soundtrack, cinematography, and special effects are among the best ever crafted for the screen. And despite its nearly three-hour runtime, it keeps you riveted with a perfect balance of tense action, tear-jerking moments, and thought-provoking themes. Interstellar is a celebration of classic epics like Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey, drawing inspiration from their awe inspiring visuals and epic score. Like those films, it will be remembered as a cinematic achievement. Put simply, Interstellar is meant to be watched on the big screen."
2018.10.03,10,"After seeing Christopher Nolan's Interstellar it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie had such an impact emotionally on the entire audience. Just as Nolan provided amazing twists and turns in previous films, such as 'The Prestige' and 'Inception', he delivers at his best in Interstellar. I first saw this movie on my 18th birthday, I thought it was a great surprise and gift. The music for the motion picture, created by Hans Zimmer, was absolutely incredible. At parts in the movie my heart was pounding and it felt as if it was, in some ways, real life. I love the part (spoiler) when Matt Damon's character dies in the spaceship explosion and Cooper docks to the space station as it is spinning in space, the music gave me goosebumps. This is a story that focuses on family. The main character (Cooper) leaves his son and daughter behind on a space expedition to save the human race. He travels through a wormhole and explores different planets to determine if they are capable of sustaining human life. One of my favorite parts in the movie (spoiler) is when relativity comes into play. A huge wave hits their spaceship and they are stuck on this water planet for over an hour. But due to the gravitational pull on this planet, he ends up spending 23 earth years on it. When he returns to the original ship he had received many messages from his son and daughter. (Spoiler) Over the space of a few hours (his time) he had witnessed his son graduate from high school, get married, have his own son, watch that son pass away, and more. In the end, he returns and his daughter is now an old woman. He promised her that he would come back to her, he fulfilled his promise. This is a very intense and inspiring sci-fi film. It is motivational and teaches us of the importance of family and love."
2022.02.14,8,"One of the best movies u will be watching again and again, would take you on interstellar travel making you learn many new things and think deep.it creats an ambience u become deeply engrossed in."
2021.02.26,9,"I watched this incredible movie almost 10-11 time. Not just I loved this movie, the reason for watching this film is the concept that Sir Christopher Nolan presented in this movie. The way he plotted every scene is just heart touching and must gave the viewers goosbumps, The concept of Dimensions and blackhole, time it just awesome. As a physics lover this is the perfect movie for them who love physics and also persue there career on physics must watch this movie."
2025.02.05,10,"It's an incredible science fiction film, not only because of its scientific and visual realism, but also because it's a film that talks about a father's love for his children. Many people find this film confusing and also that the part about love transcending space-time is somewhat cringeworthy, but it doesn't bother me at all. It's a film that manages to convey a variety of emotions: anger, happiness, sadness, tension, etc. The premise shows a future in which the Earth is being destroyed by dust clouds, that is, by nature itself, and they have to find a way to take humanity to another planet. The basic premise is well developed, and the film manages to focus well on it. The relationship between the characters is very good. Practically all the actors have chemistry with each other. Many people find the scientific part boring, but even without understanding it, people can enjoy the film. Other people find it cringeworthy that the film focuses on love, which is the main premise of the film, and all of this is well developed. The film's script is perfect. Initially, the part about the Phantom and 'them' is confusing, but in the end (which is even more confusing) it is explained. All of this can be open to theories, and the ending of the film is also open-ended. Again, many people think this ending is anticlimactic, and I disagree. It's incredible. The visuals are simply beautiful. Nolan's realism is incredible, the practical effects are perfect, the performances manage to convey the characters' feelings to us. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is SPECTACULAR. There's no way to complain about the audiovisual part of the film. It's probably my favorite film of all time, and one of the best films ever made."
2014.11.19,6,"I initially saw the trailer for Interstellar a few months ago and immediately decided that, as the trailer painted it as a dull, rather uninspiring sci-fi epic that I was not going to part with my cash or time by going to see it. Over the last few weeks, as the promotional machine has turned it's wheels and, following many positive reviews both in the media and by trusted friends of mine, I took the day off work purely to go and see Interstellar. I have to say, partly because so many reviews and friends had said 'you've really go to see it in the cinema'. So I didn't want to miss out. I started the film, full of anticipation, that I was truly going to see a masterpiece of cinema with a great cast, engaging dialogue, a thought provoking plot and stunning visuals and, well, it had stunning visuals (apart from the external spacecraft shots looking like something from 'Star Fleet') and, not much else. To be fair there was a LOT of dialogue. And several of the lines delivered by the robots approached humour. Had it have been around an hour shorter I could possibly have brought myself towards saying it was enjoyable but, in the main I REALLY had to try hard to enjoy this film. It's a strange one as it wasn't bad enough to be terrible but was nowhere near good enough to be enjoyable. At one point I was truly fighting the urge to get up and walk out but didn't as I assumed we were near the end (we weren't, there was still an hour and a half to go) I love Christopher Nolan's films but this smacks of a director being given far too much praise and far too large a budget to play with. Maybe I should have taken more notice of the trailer."
2024.12.08,10,"Interstellar is a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, not just because of its grand visuals or the complex scientific ideas it presents, but because of its emotional depth and philosophical musings. Watching it feels like taking a journey-not only into space but into the heart of human existence itself. Christopher Nolan's ambitious vision transcends the typical boundaries of a science fiction movie, leaving you with a sense of awe and a heavy introspection about what it means to be human, the nature of time, and how love can be an intangible yet powerful force. The first thing that struck me about Interstellar was its scale. From the hauntingly beautiful shots of space to the sweeping landscapes of Earth's dying environment, the film constantly challenges you to consider the vastness of the universe in relation to the fragility of our existence. As a viewer, you're made acutely aware of how small we are in the grand scheme of things, yet at the same time, the story amplifies the power of human resilience and hope. The visual effects are breathtaking, and for a moment, it's easy to get lost in the spectacle. But beneath all that, the film quietly asks, 'What is it that makes us fight so hard for survival, even when all seems lost?' I found Interstellar to be an incredibly emotional experience. At its heart, it's not just about saving the planet, but about saving what we love and what we hold dear. Cooper's relationship with his daughter, Murph, is the emotional spine of the film, and it's a story of love that stretches across dimensions of time and space. The way Nolan blends the cold, impersonal theories of space with the very human emotions of family is striking. The theme of love transcending time-shown through Cooper's connection with Murph-feels both hopeful and haunting. As someone who's personally experienced the loss of time with loved ones, the idea that love might be the one force that can bridge the insurmountable gaps between us struck a deep chord. The film's emotional weight rests on this idea, and it gave me a sense of bittersweet wonder. While the film explores some complex scientific ideas, I appreciated that Nolan doesn't treat the audience like they have to be physics experts to appreciate it. Yes, the theories around black holes, time dilation, and relativity are intricate, but they are not just a backdrop for the narrative-they also serve to deepen the emotional stakes. As Cooper and his team journey through space, the passage of time on Earth and their inability to communicate with loved ones back home became one of the most poignant aspects of the film. It made me reflect on how fragile human connections can be, especially in the face of vast, uncontrollable forces. Watching Cooper, the astronaut, struggle with his desire to save humanity and his need to be with his children was painful and relatable. There's also something deeply philosophical about Interstellar. At its core, it's a film about human ambition, survival, and our innate desire to understand the universe. It poses profound questions: How far are we willing to go to ensure our species' survival? How do we reconcile the future of humanity with our individual lives and relationships? And ultimately, what makes us human in the first place? These are questions that don't have easy answers, and that's what I appreciate most about the film-it doesn't offer up a simple, comfortable resolution. Instead, it challenges you to think, to feel, and to wrestle with the existential dilemmas that we may one day face. One aspect of Interstellar that I found both frustrating and fascinating was its pacing. While I was completely absorbed during the first half of the film, the latter part of the movie, especially the resolution, can feel overly abstract and even slightly indulgent at times. Some might argue that it loses its way, leaning into metaphysical and philosophical concepts at the expense of narrative clarity. Yet, I couldn't help but admire Nolan's willingness to take risks with the storytelling. The film doesn't adhere to traditional expectations-it pushes boundaries and dares to explore uncharted emotional and intellectual territories, even if it means sacrificing conventional storytelling for more challenging ideas. In the end, Interstellar is a film that defies easy categorization. It's not simply a space epic or a disaster film; it's a meditation on time, love, sacrifice, and the human condition. It's a movie that made me look at the stars with both wonder and humility. Its emotional complexity and thought-provoking ideas ensure that it stays with you, prompting endless questions long after you've left the theater. And while I may not fully understand every concept it introduces, that's part of the beauty of Interstellar-it leaves you thinking, wondering, and, most importantly, feeling."
2014.11.27,6,"This movie really disappointed me. I liked Christopher Nolan's films and made sure I read very little about this before I went to see it. It is ultimately about a man who loves his children. You can tell he loves his children because he never stops going on about them. He runs the full gamut of emotions showing his love for his kids like a deranged single mother on Facebook constantly posting 'Like if you love your children' Anyway he goes on a space mission and leaves his beloved children to save the world. Whilst in space he discovers a fat Matt Damon who has apparently run out of provisions, judging by the size of him I found that hard to believe. The film looked and sounded great but I couldn't get over the man constantly moaning and thought the ending was a bit obvious and ripped off 2001 and Contact. The best bit was when fat Matt Damon died."
2015.03.19,1,"As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers. I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold. Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects. On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous. The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down. On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense. If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?). Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on. They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information. Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughter And how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot. In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies."
2023.05.02,10,"Best science-fiction movie ever. Love Christopher Nolan and the masterpiece he delivers! Visual effects and physical accuracy of things is amazing. This is likely one of my top 5 favorited movies of all time I want to erase it from my memory just to see it again. Kip Thorne, the man behind all of the math and science, was an Executive Producer on this film. Listening to someone as clever as this person speak about how wormholes, black holes, and space/time operate according to scientific discoveries is both fascinating and humbling. It is a movie worth watching and deserves more rating. You should watch it, promise you won't regret it!."
2021.06.05,10,A complete masterpiece. The best movie I've ever seen in my life. Christopher Nolan has done it again.
2023.07.23,10,"Their were some flaws with the Antagonists and the pacing, but other than that....... OH MY WORDS! WOW! I can't even describe how amazing this movie is, because there are millions of things I can say. There were a whole lot more positive things than negative things in this movie. It was confusing at first, but at the end, it all made sense. Imagine you were the main character of this movie, though. This wasn't even a movie, this was a whole experience. My favorite things about this movie were the music, the Cinematography, and the ending. I loved every character in this movie, and the acting was phenomenal as well. This is definitely a must-watch."
2022.12.15,9,"'Interstellar' is a beautifully crafted movie that explores the limits of human understanding and the boundless potential of the human spirit. The story follows a group of astronauts as they embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. The movie is masterfully directed by Christopher Nolan, and features a talented cast of actors, including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complements the film's epic and emotional story. The movie's visual effects are breathtaking, and the production design is top-notch. The movie's use of special effects, particularly in its depiction of the vastness of space, is truly awe-inspiring. Overall, 'Interstellar' is a must-see movie for fans of science fiction and anyone who appreciates a well-told, thought-provoking story. It's a movie that will leave you feeling inspired and moved, and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."
2024.12.14,10,"When Interstellar released in theaters in December 2014, I was not familiar with Christopher Nolan, and I barely remember seeing advertisements for the film. As a result, I did not go see it in theaters. My first time seeing it was at home shortly after its digital release, where I was surprised at the stunning visuals and storyline. Now, a decade later, I had the chance to redeem myself and see it on the big screen with the IMAX re-release. While I have seen this movie 4 or 5 times before, it did not feel that way watching it in IMAX for the first time. The cinematography for the scenes in space is breathtaking, and the special effects still hold up 10 years later! Even if you've seen this movie before, seeing it in IMAX is well worth it!"
2023.04.30,10,"I've seen this movie at least ten times, I try to watch it at least once a year. I had some friends over last night to watch it, all of whom had never seen it. For nearly three hours, six people sat in complete silence watching this story about family, love, and exploration. No one said a word. When it was over I looked over at my friends, hoping they had liked it half as much as I do. 'I think that was the best movie I have ever seen,' was the general consensus. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say this: if you haven't seen this yet, and you consider yourself someone who likes movies, you owe it to yourself to watch it. There is simply no better film in existence."
2014.11.13,6,"The word I'd use to define this story is contorted..Nolan's intelligence is out of discussion but the problem here is the difficulty of finding a key. All of this effort, all these questions, all of this movie and for what? There is no answer there. Nolan's mind has conceived Memento, The Prestige, Inception, and now Interstellar, always exploring relevant existential questions but there's always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of proportions. The movies are about love, they're spiritually generic and require a lot of production.. But the overall idea is that the viewer doesn't know where the story is going.. Again the previous question, what for..?!"
2020.12.30,9,You will be on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. Masterpiece! The only thing i regret is that I did not see it in the movie theaters
2014.12.17,7,"Great music. An extremely talented cast. Amazing special effects. Captivating issues to contemplate. So why do I think I will not ponder this film long after I have viewed it? The story is convoluted, though interesting. All the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale that tells us what? Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there. I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final 'explanation' of the film's phenomena has a 'Sixth Sense' feeling to it.  I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's '2001' or the atmospherics of 'Blade Runner' or the thrilling ride of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'."
2014.11.18,1,"This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway ..... Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around. There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then. A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy. They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible.  So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it.  No, no, noooo. They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there.  And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes?  Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan? By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh!  And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh!  And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned. Not Nolan. NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans. Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing. And I loved Inception!"
2023.07.27,10,"I can only but praise this movie for its great balance between action and drama. Nolan, known for his amazing story telling, really knocks it out of the park here. Not only is the story very interesting, filled with curiosity and suspense, the images are absolutely stunning. The computer-generated images of the fictional black hole are by far the best I have seen and the fact that these are supported by science makes it even more impressive. The music by Hans Zimmer perfectly captures the setting of the movie and is also one of the best soundtrack I have experienced in a movie. The strong cast lives up to its reputation with lead actor Matthew McConaughey embodying Cooper."
2024.11.10,9,Interstellar was amazing. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The story visuals and music were all great. It is just a powerful experience through space and time. The film blends science fiction with deep human emotions exploring love sacrifice and survival. The visuals especially the black hole are stunning and realistic. The performances are top notch with an unforgettable portrayal of a father torn between saving humanity and his family. The emotional depth of the story makes it even more powerful. It stays with you long after watching. I would give it a 9 out of 10. Truly unforgettable.
2022.06.28,10,"This movie is simply amazing. The acting, the writing, the emotion that this film holds is simply outstanding. I cry almost every time I see it. However, the greatest part of this movie is the entire storyline. It's a complex, masterful and very imaginable plot, that definitely holds your attention the whole time. Please just watch this movie, it is spectacular."
2022.07.17,10,"Curse, food deficiencies, and absence of oxygen. As indicated by the book The Science of Interstellar by Kip Thorne, the film envisions a future where a blend of disasters lessens the number of inhabitants in North America ten times or more, with comparable ramifications until the end of the world. Every dream, hope and theory make this films perfectly. The main things astronomical science and intimate human connection playing another level."
2023.02.18,9,"'Interstellar' is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful sci-fi film directed by Christopher Nolan. Set in a future where the Earth is dying, the film follows a team of explorers who embark on a dangerous mission to find a new home for humanity. Led by Matthew McConaughey's character, the team travels through a wormhole in space, facing numerous obstacles and breathtaking vistas that will leave you in awe. The film's impressive special effects, combined with Hans Zimmer's masterful score, create an immersive and captivating experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. At its core, 'Interstellar' is a story about the power of love and human resilience in the face of impossible odds. The themes of time, space, and relativity are explored in a thought-provoking manner, adding layers of depth and complexity to the already compelling plot. The film's finale will leave you both inspired and moved, as it touches on the importance of love, family, and our place in the universe. 'Interstellar' is a masterpiece that sets the standard for modern science fiction films."
2022.05.05,10,This movie is insane the graphics were amazing and the way they were able to make the space and galaxy look so real and the acting was 10/10 and i would die to watch this movie again for the first time it changed my mind on things and it literally is the most perfect movie eve u don't think any movie could do better it just shows how the galaxy could be and that we should look more and this movie deserves all the oscors.
2014.11.27,6,"Sorry but who hyped this movie? Did they pay you for the reviews? Physically so much sh**. How the f**k can a space ship need more time to get to a position than a guy by feet? Or is able to escape from a planet with more gravity than the earth but on earth they need a rocket?? Even better was the situation of the waves which are big as a mountain but NO ONE saw them until they where next to them, are you kidding me?  enough with the physic, what about the dialogs? the only funny stuff was the robot! If it wasn't hyped i would not write but i try to rate it rationally: so 6"
2025.05.20,10,"Interstellar is a really great movie with a smart and interesting story. It talks about space and big ideas but also about family, love, and hope. The story is easy to follow and keeps you curious the whole time with exciting moments and surprises. Hans Zimmer's music is amazing and makes the movie feel even more exciting and emotional. The space scenes look beautiful and very real. The movie also uses real science to make it believable, which makes it even cooler. Interstellar is a must-watch for anyone who likes exciting, thoughtful, and powerful movies that make you think and feel a lot. 10/10 2nd favorite after The Dark Knight."
2014.11.08,6,"Setting aside the science behind the film (and yes, you really do need to have an advanced degree to understand it), the thing that most takes away from this film is lack of a coherent story. Too many loose ends and questions arise that can't simply be overtaken by the 'wow factor' of the visuals. Example: Matthew McConaughey plays a former NASA engineer/pilot who is/was, according to Michael Caine's character (his former boss), the best NASA had ever produced. And yet McConaughey's character didn't know nor had been tapped for a secret project to launch people into a nearby black hole/corridor to another galaxy--a program that had been going on for years while earth was slowly turning into a dust ball. Wouldn't you think NASA would have located their best & brightest to launch him into the black hole? McConaughey's character, a widower, doesn't have to do much agonizing to leave his two young children behind on a multi-year mission to get to the black hole, through it, and come back with news from 'the other side' on where humankind can pick up and move to. Eventually his daughter goes to work for NASA (she's just there one day, all grown up, no back story) and the daughter and her brother both become estranged. Again, no back story to speak of, we just have to accept it (the film is already too bloody long so there was no time to develop the characters). Ultimately it is a movie about a father and a daughter and everything else is backdrop to propel that story. The problem is, most of that sweet story is lost in loud special effects and rabbit trails. I'm glad I watched it--once. That's all I'll watch it."
2014.11.08,1,"It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel. I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for me. Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my life back!"
2021.05.27,10,"A wonderful and very impressive science fiction movie, I suggest you watch this movie and do not miss it."
2022.06.04,10,Some movies are close to heart. This is one of them... It's more than just a movie... I cried when I watched this movie... Thanks so much for the director for directing such kind of movie.
2015.11.22,9,"This is the best movie, which blends the time travel and lot of information into a single script, it takes me 3 times to get the story completely. The director have moved the story in a nice way which makes the people to think before they can watch the movie. This also made me to think of 'Is there really a 5th dimension??'. Sure if you watch it deeply you can never get out of the concept unless you are fully aware of the story before you see. The screenplay was really outstanding and provided the best visual. Sound - nothing to mention, it was really awesome. And about the cast, they were excellent and blend nicely into the character. Lets hope there is a sequel to this movie which suggest how she solved the equation with her fathers help and it may help me to get the story to full end. This is really challenging story and I will be waiting for its sequel."
2015.11.22,10,"Good Day Everyone! Hopefully your having an 'Interstellar' day, sorry for the pun! So on with the review!  Christopher Nolan takes a huge step against the mega-hits of 2014's summer releases with a sci-fi epic of very BRAVE proportion. Enter 'Interstellar'.  A team of scientists, pitted against a dying and hostile Earth with dust storms reminiscent of the Dust bowl of the 1930's, discern the source of strange happenings within our galaxy that may lead to our salvation. With the advent of suffocation and an eerie force later alluding to a gravitational anomaly, NASA begins operates in secret and dispatches the world's bravest into the stars. Leading the ensemble cast, Matthew McConaughey, stars as Cooper, an ex-pilot-turned-farmer who receives a strange decoded message from his daughter Murph, played by Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy, that eventually leads them to the start of this epic journey to save humanity.  Will these scientist achieve the impossible by exploring an unnatural occurrence of a wormhole near Saturn and find the habitants of Earth a new home? Or will all be lost? Packed with visual feasts, a fantastic musical score and an emotional undertone that will shake even the most hardest war veteran to tears, Cooper and team set out to perform the impossible before nature itself threatens to stop them."
2025.04.29,8,"I had to rewatch it cause it's leaving Netflix. And this is such an epic that it deserves a rewatch at your leisure, on Netflix. At least that's how I view Netflix. It felt kind of like a chore though cause it's so long and I only had a few days to decide on and I thought I'd maybe split it, but once I started it I just got into it immediately so that was last night. I didn't remember much from it apart from the concept and some key moments, but it was such an experience I couldn't put it down so I just sat through almost three hours of this and loved it. It's so epic and then so simple but oh so creative but also such an amazing story, stripped down to the basics but so humane, emotional and thought-provoking, scary but uplifting, it's just everything. I have no idea whether the science makes sense in this and I am unclear on some of the logic and sequence of events and if you ask me in a month I'll have no idea how any of this works, but it is majestic and it doesn't rely of special effects, although it does have some amazing visuals, but it makes the story so personal and heartbreaking that it's just the full package. The perfect dystopian sci-fi movie with a good ending and some cool aha moments. Also that moon landing redaction and spin was crazy I gotta say."
2018.07.13,9,"Fascinating story with beautiful scenes and music that really draws me in. I start with why it still does not get 10 points. The early sequence when Cooper hacks into the drone and controls it seems a bit awkward to me if it was meant to characterize him. And although it is a clever idea to watch Cooper observe the past (and not simply time travelling) I was a bit disappointed because the story is not consequent in the aspect of manipulating the past. On the other hand, I was intrigued by the aspect of ageing as a consequence of gravitation and acceleration and how this is incorporated in the script. What I further like about this movie is the visualization of higher dimensions. And the fact that the are no aliens, only human beings. The size and desolation of the universe that we see emphasizes the message that humanity itself is responsible for our planet."
2014.11.13,7,"Interstallar (2014) This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best—shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance—it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed. But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like 'Memento' takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call 'meaning.' They are entertainments.  'Interstellar' is purely horrible science—it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something 'deep' about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing. Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in 'Batman Rises' are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But 'Interstallar' takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see 'Gravity' for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature. There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick—and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker—Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big. See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.)  Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints—as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google. But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms."
2025.06.06,10,"A Second Viewing, A First-Class Masterpiece To say Interstellar is an emotional, mind-blowing rollercoaster feels like an understatement. I've just rewatched it, nearly a decade after first seeing it back in 2015 or 2016, and I'm honestly stunned. Not just by the scope, or the visuals, or the sound, but by how well it holds itself together. I'm struggling to quantify just how good it is. This isn't just one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. It might well be one of the greatest films, full stop, in any genre. There's a weight to it. A gravity. Not just the black holes and time distortion, but the emotional pull: the love of family, the will to survive, the longing for something more, something better. It manages to be intimate and cosmic at the same time, and that's no small feat. I found myself looking for reasons to knock a point or two off. Maybe it's too ambitious? Maybe it leans a bit into sentimentality? But I couldn't find anything that really stuck. Nolan weaves so many complex ideas together, from relativity to hope, from loneliness to legacy, and it never feels like it's trying too hard. It just works. It channels the spirit of Clarke's 2001 and 2010, but adds a modern weight: the ache of climate collapse, the fear of failure, the hope in exploration. The mission to survive isn't just practical. It's deeply human. Somehow, Interstellar balances the impossible, theoretical physics, raw emotion, and breathtaking visuals, and still keeps its story tight, and engrossing. It is, quite simply, astonishing."
2014.11.08,6,"I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell."
2014.11.06,5,"Even the title Interstellar evokes greatness, and the movie express this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture quality (go to IMAX 70mm) and definitely communicated by soundtrack. Nolan knows that when you have Hans Zimmer on board you have an insurance: with his music you can transform even your dog daily service in an epic movie. Moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give a great pace to the story. 9/10 on everything up to now. But when it comes down to the plot we barely reach 6/10. I will never understand why those Hollywood mega-productions that can do everything and have all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across the plot. While looking at the movie it is like realizing that some good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with great details like the dust, the robots, the hibernation beds, and then somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. Here some: First of all,the whole thing does not add up: the first time Cooper leave earth, who sent him the NASA coordinate?? NON SENSE. second, at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too much emphasis has been placed on the message 'STAY'. I understand it adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the ending. From there on you are only curious on how he will communicate back, which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie. Third, I loved the transition between the departure from home with the truck and the rocket launch BUT wait a moment. Three stages Saturn V rocket to reach the Earth orbit (..OK they were using spares from Apollo mission..OK..) and in all the rest of the movie these guys land and launch from 3 different earth-like planets by using simply the small spacecraft??? C'mon.  Fourth, OK, you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to your daughter? Of course binary coded coordinates of NASA installation!! Not your name, not her name, but coordinates of the NASA launch site, so that the younger-yourself can LEAVE!If only all that you want is for him to STAY which is what you will send immediately after. OK maybe he do not know that he, him self, will start the whole thing just by following those coordinates..:/ WTF!!why?? Guys, I can understand you need to send Cooper to NASA, but couldn't you find something else? Fifth. This is minor, but really annoys me that in 2014, in the Interstellar production, you, screenwriters team, need AGAIN to make someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create AGAIN the run-for-it-but-I-cant scene, on a planet in which every minute is a year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some unknown data!? C'MON!  You guys, have the best technicians and movie artisans, can afford almost everything you like, then again, why you have to slide on the banana peel? I will never understand."
2014.11.07,9,"Interstellar is a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, beautiful, complex and thrilling adventure.The film is a mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty.Visually it is one of the best film ever made if not the best. Totally, is it the best film ever made? i don't know. A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely.  Performances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity, Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental.  Don't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible."
2014.11.08,8,"With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work. At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism. The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long. There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10"
2014.11.08,10,"The most original story I have ever seen and the most realistic view of space ever depicted of film. The complicated plot points in this one is sky high even surpassing the imagination made that based Inception. The plot made this movie just makes it harder to direct for Christopher Nolan. It is not a question that the screenplay of this film isn't the best work of Nolan but who the hell cares, no one could do it any better than Nolan himself with this unbelievable script. I was literally mind blown from the dialogue and script. The movie itself made me question my very existence. This life changing film creates possibilities and new theories on space and time. How gravity and love could help you communicate with the past physically and the concept of the 5th dimension in the black hole that let's you communicate with the 3rd dimension just boggled my mind. It creates goosebumps on what could happen if interstellar travel is possible and if gravity and time relativity could really do equate. The concept of love in this movie as a feeling that even surpasses time, galaxy, and existence made my eyes tear, making it also a great drama. People say that great ideas alone does not make great movies but just the mere fact that this really big idea was portrayed in film is unbelievable and should be given credit for. People compare it to Kubrick's work, but it isn't just a typical 2001 Space Odyssey clone like most people say it is. It borrowed the same elements but injected in new ones. The truth is I don't want to recommend this movie to any typical moviegoer. The dialogue could be as boring as hell and the movie won't be appreciated on what it really is. This 3 hour long film is for the people who want a new story, who wants to widen their imagination, who wants to know the value of love. Yes it is full of flaws in directing as I explained because of the plot, but understanding its urge, its ambition, you could understand this movie's sense and value. This movie is a movie that you can both love and hate, whether you choose to see its flaws or see its value is up to a viewer."
2014.11.11,10,"I rarely go to the cinema any more since I have such a good entertainment system at home. I went to see this movie anyways since I didn't want to wait until it came out on blueray. I'm glad I did! There is only one thing to say to describe this movie: Mind blowing! Truly mind blowing! I had high hopes for this movie, and usually when you go in there with high expectations you almost always come out disappointed. That's not the case with this movie! It was actually far better than I had dared to dreamed about! I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards.  This movie addresses some important questions. Are humanity going to stay on the earth? Is it safe here? This is a movie about the struggle to survive. But it's so much more! It's action, love, hate and even some comedy. This movie has it all! It lasts for 2 hours and 40 minutes, but not for one moment does it get boring. There are lots of plot twists that really get your imagination going. The movie makes you do some hard thinking.  Not only is the movie exiting and entertaining, it's also estethicly pleasing! Breathtaking is the word of choise for some of the sceenes. Not to mention the music which complement the visuals so well. I haven't seen a movie so estethlicly well done since 2001 a space odessy. And that movie was famos for just that.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, do it now! This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time!"
2014.11.09,10,"Lets start by saying that i was astonished by Nolan's vision, mesmerized by the visual, captivated by the plot and touched by the characters. Having waited 11 months for this film and being a huge fan of Nolan perhaps i am not able to provide an objective opinion about this film, but all i can say is that delivered what i wanted and far more. It was astonishing. So lets start with the cinematography, and as usual with Nolan's films it looks pristine. There was no shot misplaced, the tone presented by the camera movements was perfect. Every movement had a purpose and there was no unnecessary 'fluff,' hand-held cameras are used extensively and this gave the film a very pure feel. That being said there were certain scenes were our jaw will just drop. This is partly because of Nolan's genius use of the camera and also partly because he only uses practical effects which made the entire film feel far more real and tangible. The acting in this film is fantastic, the entire sequence between Coop and his daughter at the start of the film is genuinely heart wrenching and incredibly well done by both actors, and throughout the film the acting never once becomes wooden. A quick mention to Hans Zimmer for the most incredible score that held together the film and added so much to the feeling of uncertainty, not once has Zimmer made a bad score and i feel that this is his best score yet. Onto the point of Nolan's films the core focus and what drives the plot is family. Throughout the film i feel Nolan is saying that through this journey mankind is 'evolving'(too say any more would spoil the film) and throughout the film there is a sense that every misstep makes the characters better and smarter. Throughout the entire film some characters constantly say 'we did this i theory but it is completely different in reality' which i feel shows that as the movie progress so do the characters in terms of knowledge and understanding and by the end of the film some even seem like they are a 'higher being.' However throughout the film none of these high concepts feel like they are out of reach or that the film is impossible to relate to because throughout the film the one thing that holds it together is love and family and unbreakable relationships and this remains a touchstone throughout the film that everyone can relate to and understand the film. Let me say this now, although it appears to resemble 2001 I do not believe that it does. 2001 is a very clinical detached film which in my opinion is the greatest film ever, this film is very different. It may be an incredible space Odyssey but unlike 2001 it has 'blood in its veins' and perhaps Interstellar becomes too sentimental at points and it compromises the plot because of it but i feel like this is the point of the film. Nolan wanted to make an epic journey that could be related to(I would argue that 2001 is the greatest film ever but that it is difficult to grasp because of the clinical nature of it). Nolan definitely did this with Interstellar, it is a film that can be grasped and interpreted and related to, but he also made a tremendously epic film that i not simple and tackles subject matter that many directors before have struggled to even get a grasp on themselves never mind convey it in a film so grand. Is this the greatest film ever, o, but it is definitely up there and the fact that a film so complex is the largest film event of the year shows that the audiences that go in their droves to see this film aren't that stupid either. To conclude I salute Christopher Nolan for this film, it was pure incredible film making the lime of which i haven't seen in years, the fact that all i have thought about since the screening is this film and that even after 3 hours I still felt like there should be more shows in my opinion just how great a film this is. This is the best film i have seen in many years and it is my opinion Nolan's crowning work, there has not been a film this ambitious and with this complex a vision made so well since 2001. I will end as I started, incredible cinema."
2014.11.08,10,"Interstellar- An inter galactic space travel to other galaxies through worm holes by other dimension of time using gravitational physics mixed up with time warping and relativity concepts. yeah yeah.... by now you can understand the depth of the movie which Nolan wanted to show the world in his latest offering. I went to the film with maximum expectations and it exceeded in every aspect. The plot is quite simple. but the way of execution is complex. The film starts off on a smooth note and the excitement increases as the movie goes. I liked every bit of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is awesome throughout the film as his expression in some particular scenes leave u in an awe. Marvellous job by him to carry the film. All the lead cast played exceptionally well. People are asking me whether it is of Gravity range??? I simply asked them back why do u want to compare this with that?? I seriously don't like to compare two movies even if they are of the same genre. I don't want to play a spoilsport here so I'm not revealing or jotting any plot lines here. The screenplay, as usually by JONATHAN NOLAN, is very gripping and he surely does a remarkable job with the script too. Another big gem for the film is its BGM. What can i say about Hans Zimmer which u already don't know? The BGM gelled so well with the movie that u almost think the BGM is a representation of on screen presentation. Some scenes got much elevated by the impeccable work of Hans. His use of instruments and strings require a special mention. Especially during the final 5-10 minutes of the movie, the BGM is so good that it almost left me speechless and haunted me the rest of the day. A huge respect to Zimmer. Coming to my movie God CHRISTOPHER NOLAN....... There was a time when i thought what if a directer directs only Gentlemen Class movies and not the silly stuff to hang around the industry. Then i came to know about Nolan and his works. At first i was thrilled by his taking and got attached to his movies so much i cant think of not expecting a better output from him in his next.... He is a master in movie making and a true gentlemen movie maker. The reason i used the word Gentlemen Moviemaker is that his works needs to be understood but not only watched for time-pass. Every dialog in his movie has a meaning and every frame in the movie has to do something with the plot. In Interstellar, he once again showed us why he is such a remarkable movie maker and a splendid director by delivering the most spectacular experience of a space travel. The depth of the plot is so well handled. Every frame counts and every dialog has a reason. He never even wastes a single second of the film with unwanted stuff. As always, the story is to the point and goes on increasing the intensity exponentially. If i say more about the plot, i may spoil the experience for some who didn't watch it yet. So all i can say is that this movie is masterclass in every aspect. Finally, dedicating his own dialog from The Dark Knight to him, i would like to say..... He is a silent guardian of movie making..... A watchful protector of the script...... A DARK KNIGHT of the industry....... I salute him with all of me and expect many more top notch directional ventures from him. P.S.: I pity IMDb accepts only 10 stars(It may be my exaggeration, but this is what i feel). Like"
2020.07.17,7,There are some interesting ideas and some great moments in this original piece of work. Ultimately it doesn't quite get there for me though in terms of the overall story and the science. It's ambition together with some decent performances along the way elevate it into the above average bracket.
2014.11.05,10,"I am writing this to just say if you love science and space this is the movie to go watch before you die. I am simply enthralled and it is as I always like my entertainment to be, start slowly, gradually build up and bam like an orgasm it ends. It is one of the finest movies made in the history. But as many people who went with me couldn't comprehend the sheer genius of the filmmaker and the space time complexity so if you are one of them that don't want to understand and just want something happening that doesn't utilize your neurons then I guess don't watch it. To say the least, if I were a girl I would let Nolans' brain do it with me any time."
2017.10.16,6,"2001 is my all time favorite movie Blade Runner is one of my all time favourites too I pretty much loved all Nolan's movies except for the Dark Knight Rises So, theoretically this should have been a great time and great movie... it wasn't The story, the science, the pace where all wrong in so many ways. I even gave the movie a second chance at home, but things just didn't improve I just can't believe this has such a high rating, it just doesn't deserve it"
2014.11.07,2,"Interstellar, while visually stunning, is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to at-least bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level. Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions. This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners. We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act.  Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT.  Come on Nolan, you can do better."
2014.11.07,10,"Interstellar Review(SPOILER ALERT): Christopher Nolan's latest endeavor reaches out into the farthest corners of space, quite unlike Inception where he plummeted the depths of the human mind. The premise is the oft quoted disaster scenario; only this time it appears to be much more realistic with food running out for earth's 6 billion inhabitants and mankind seemingly destined to suffocate as the oxygen content of the atmosphere starts to dwindle. However there is a distant hope for salvation- a wormhole has been placed in the vicinity of Saturn (cue 2001: A Space Odyssey) seemingly by some 'higher beings' which may provide an escape route for mankind to reach out to potentially habitable worlds. Only if we can overcome Murphy's law (whatever can happen, will happen, including whatever bad can happen). Steps in Matthew McCounaughey (Cooper) to head an expedition of 4 travellers {Dr Amelia Brand(Hathaway-who leaves behind her ageing father, Professor Brand AKA Michael Caine), Romilly(Gyasi) and Doyle(Bentley)}, accompanied by 2 magnificent robots, TARS and CASE (although constructed in the spirit of HAL, these two AI are quite the extreme opposite of HAL in every sense). Cooper's sacrifice is leaving behind his two young children{Tom(child –Timothy Chalamet, adult-Casey Affleck) and Murph(child-Mackenzie Foy, adult-Jessica Chastain)}, not knowing if he will ever make it back to them again. Crossing the wormhole leads our explorers into a system orbiting a black hole (The Gargantuan), with three potentially habitable planets named after the brave explorers who made a near-definite one-way trip to these worlds. The movie is a fantastic sequence of interstellar adventures, but does not need any 'Aliens' to spoil the show (does mankind really need an external influence to destroy it, when we are experts at self destruction?).  Not wanting to spoil the rest of the movie, it suffices to say that the final act of the movie is a dizzying sequence combining human bravado, survival instincts and love into a heady mix that takes time and possibly repeated viewing to really absorb the meaning of. Suffice to say, the man who played the priest (read Man of Faith) in my erstwhile favourite science fiction movie, Contact, sees his career complete a nice circle by himself making a jump of faith, both metaphorically and literally, this time. Add to this the hauntingly beautiful music of Hans Zimmer, and a couple of 'wow' moments, one of which leads to the demise of the antagonist (yes there is one), and you have the complete package. The last scenes are guaranteed to make your eyes swell up as a satisfying conclusion is reached to this grand tale. McCounaghey and Chastain play stellar roles, and this film is guaranteed for Oscar nomination in multiple categories, technical as well as acting. It also demonstrates the superiority of 2-D hand-held cameras over the current slew of 3-D digital shooting, and is possibly the last film to be shot on IMAX. As much as it might seem an action adventure fantasy, it is much more a parent-child love story than anything else, and may not appeal to all audiences, hence the fiercely divisive opinions amongst critics already. Over time, this shall be acknowledged as one of the masterpieces of 21st century filmmaking, much in the way 2001 attained its acclaim years after release."
2019.11.05,8,"First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids. There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter 'scientist' is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the 'critics'. Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be. Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority."
2021.01.19,10,Honestly i thought this is just for this movie until i watched TENET and realized that i have to at least watch Nolan's movies 5 times in order to get more fact.
2015.04.13,10,"I'm going to keep it as brief as possible with no spoilers.I went to watch this movie by myself in a small theater on a less populated day of the week just so I could watch it with no distractions and really soak in the movie.I enjoyed every single minute of it from beginning to end.I felt as if I was in the journey along with what the character was going on.It kept me at the edge of my seat and for a moment I almost forgot I was watching a movie and felt as if it was reality,causing me to feel the emotions of the movie as if I were experiencing each moment in first person.The storyline,the theme,the dialog,the soundtrack was an absolute masterpiece. BRAVO !! INTERSTELLAR YOU ARE NOW IN MY CLASSIC COLLECTION."
2018.08.12,8,"This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists. You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out 'What's in your safe?' The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors."
2014.11.09,10,"I knew something about the plot and thought that it may not be anything more than what I knew. But I was wrong! I was amazed at how Nolan unwrapped one surprise after another and by the time the movie completed and end credits started to roll, I was left speechless for 10 minutes or so. Some of the audience started clapping when the movie endedsome just sat on their chairs dumbstruck! Outside, people were busy discussing the movie that they have just seenit is a rare sight! I was trying to analyse and understand what I just saw. I need to see it another two times at least to understand this amazing movie better! I need to understand the science the movie has spoken about before I can try to understand it! Nolan has gone a step beyond what we have expected out of him with this movie. I am amazed at how he can reinvent himself every time! Unlike other Nolan movies, this one is strong on emotions as well..at the core it is father - daughter relationship. We had seen only a glimpse of father -son relationship in 'Inception'this one could bring tears to your eyes seeing the performance of the actors. I don't like to give away much Some pointers by me.. You need to brush up science and know at least the basics like time, black holes, relativity, gravity, etc to understand the science part of this movie. Do not spread spoilers on this movielet everyone go into the theater with no knowledge of this movie to be amazed like me! Watch it 3 times or more times to understand it better!"
2024.11.20,7,"Good film. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys. Where to start? The overtly obvious and cliché ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The 'dramatic' content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do. Some cliché shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The 'beings' (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece. 'Human nature' is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes. The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie."
2014.11.14,8,"Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings. His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty. I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time. However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time. I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry."
2015.03.15,7,"Like everyone I was psyched out of my mind for interstellar.I was further psyched when I took a look at this movie's rating on IMDb after it's release.This movies has some good elements but you can clearly identify some of the cons of this movie. The best thing about this movie is Matthew McCounaughey who is simply on a roll. His acting was phenomenal. The supporting cast was also great. This movie has a really strong ensemble cast. The score by Hans Zimmer is really good especially because it merges fluently with the dystopian atmosphere of the movie and the visual are a treat for the eyes along with the cinematography. The direction is good and has Nolan's innovative touch. Now with the negatives.First of all this movie is confusing to the average movie goer. It is confusing because it uses a lot of fancy words and scientific terms to cover it's not-so-interesting plot.The movie tends to drag on and the dialogue is not that great. Also the movie is too complicated aside from the terms used in the dialogue. It is proof that just because a movie is different and overly complex ,it isn't great or 'stellar'. The movie is a bit boring and tries too hard to impress the viewer by further complicating itself and doesn't quite succeed in it."
2014.11.16,1,"Interstellar by Christopher Nollan Reviewed by Svetoslav Grigorov First, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses.  OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job). Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a 'serious' movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it 'scientific'??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her. The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens. P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know."
2014.11.13,10,"I watched this movie a week ago as of this writing and purposefully have waited to write this review and not be biased.  First of all the first thing that crossed my mind when I left the session was how much tense Interstellar was. It mesmerized me especially after the crew went to space and it never stopped until the film had ended. I was genuinely curious through the whole film of what was going to happen next. The action scenes were memorable. At times the silence, the pure silence, in some scenes was creepy and I felt that I was genuinely with the crew in the space. There have been a lot of criticism by people to this film because the answers that it gives are 'simple' and 'cheesy'. When watching the trailers of Interstellar one of my greatest fears was that it was to dramatic in a negative way by some dialogues like 'I'm coming back. When?'. But after seeing the film I was satisfied with the answers that it gave me. In a way you have to be open minded to watch this after all the answers, although simple, are not conventional in anyway and this is, I think, the main reason why so much criticism. But I'm truly opened to accept that when we, as humans, don't know what happens at the first time we do something, the sentiment of fear dominates us.  I truly recommend people to watch this movie called 'Interstellar'. For me it was a complete experience which I had not experienced before in the cinema. Maybe you will be troubled by some, or a lot, of the answers that the movie gives, but I think that the visuals on its own are a sufficient argument to see this. I recommend you to relax and not get worried trying to understand everything. It's difficult and maybe you'll get frustrated of how hard, at times, it gets. At the same time it is paradoxical how simple the end is. There are some things that people tend to agree both critics and lovers of Interstellar. For example, that the film is really ambitious. Personally I love when people try so much for something different and outside of the commonplace that we watch everyday and I liked very much those aspects of the films. There are some flaws of the film ? Probably, almost every film has it. Moreover, we, as humans, make a lot of mistakes most of the time. I also think that the aspect of error is being under-appreciated by some viewers. Even in the end you notice how hard and lost you are. But the brilliance, something that really captivated me, was the fact that for this complex problem a 'simple' solution was given. How beautiful it is when you take a shortcut and resolve a problem in a way which ever be made before.  Don't miss this. Love it or hate it, worth the time of watching in a big screen with the sound loud and tense. For me it was a true experience and I hope that you feel the same as me. Cheers."
2014.11.07,10,"It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined.  Here's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways. I really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw.  Some have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect.  Nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about. For those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it. A solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond. ***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT*** Let me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. 'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.' It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground. This film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow."
2015.04.17,10,"The film is one of the films that gave me ideas on how much powerful it is to tell as well researched story filled with love. For the Director, I have learn so much, from watching his film collection, how He use the word Powerful, from Inception said by Leo and in Interstellar said by Anne. The search to me is like finding who really you are in life, and when you do, always remember you can only stop time from moving when you do what you know love the most. To me Interstellar is like is a movie of all time that help you find yourself. I am proud of Mr. Nolan, and since I am In Tribeca and He is here I will be happy to meet him and learn more from his art. I watched it twice in one day, all I can say is it's a move that needs you to watch over and over and over, to understand the art of telling a story. I rate 10/10 My question for Mr Nolan is will finding the new life on the other planet stop people from harming nature?"
2019.02.19,10,I watched this movie four times and every time I feel my soul freezing I have no words to describe this movie like then deserv Hug your soul and watch this
2020.08.25,10,Surreal experience when I watched it at the movie theater. #neverforget
2023.11.01,8,"Interstellar is a interesting film that questions the time in space in our reality a film that is straight up visually impressive The story is kind of odd but it's still worth in this type of film ever since I saw this movie I've been wondering what's up in space what type of life we can live on space and how is humans can evolve it the only thing that I did not really like was the main character being very one dimensional, but other than that this has a very good premise, and they will pay the movie that has a very good set up and pay off real well the performance was very very good and direction was... well it's Christopher Nolan 8.5/10."
2024.09.28,7,"The movie starts off slow, stays slow, but finally got my attention, and it was still pretty good. The movie as almost three hous long, and didn't need to be. This movie must have cost a fortune to make. All the actors do a decent job. Matthew is actually perfect for this role. Anne Hathaway wouldn't have been my first choice for Brand. The robot (Chase) made me roll my eyes a few times. Other reviewers of this movie are right, the visuals are incredible. The wormhole and scenes in outer space are absolutely stunning, and received Oscars for it. Apparently, no one has sex in space because there is no sex or nudity in this film. All and all, it's a pretty good way to spend three hours. I give it 4 out 5 stars."
2021.10.03,10,"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Infinity out of 10. This is the 2nd time I've watched it after a few years. Yes I'm into space and everything that comes with it If you enjoy wondering what's out there or what's possible and even somewhat like Astronomy or Sciene then watch this movie. It will not fail you. I understand some parts are fictional, but who cares. It blows your mind I can't even explain it in a review. The fact he lost 74 years of his life went by and he's the same age and lost everything, but gained something is unbelievable. This movie is emotionally off your chair compelling an will open your eyes beyond what you thought possible. The actors are incredible beyond excellent. The planet they visited for 23years left me speechless. I can't believe I even wrote this much of a review. Enjoy."
2015.09.14,6,"We can't hear the dialogue Whenever they speak I barely can hear what they are saying they have spent too much too make it a great movie and I love almost all Nolan's movies but this one I was trying to enjoy.... great graphics and story line but the sound............. this is probably submitted by hundreds before me but I just want to add my voice to them I read this '''Audiences have complained about drowned out dialogue and muffled conversations, with an overbearing soundtrack that obscures major plot points. But what they do not appear to have realized is that they were experiencing the 'impressionistic way' sound was mixed in the movie''' I still don't I wanted to hear them speak sorry"
2014.11.14,3,"I heard Nolan answer a question about authenticity of the scientific basis of the movie. He 'fessed to changing things up but then said — and I agree with him — that audiences are OK with IF the movie is consistent within itself. Unfortunately, Interstellar is far from consistent. How the black hole is treated in completely nonsensical. Light doesn't escape but he and his ship, nor the bot, are stretched out into spaghetti by the gravity. Said hole is at first a safe enough distance away from the ice planet to not be a factor, but is then close enough to 'capture' their ship in it's vortex.  Why oh why did the super-evolved humans (huh?, in and of itself) put that wormhole way out in the 'burbs and then leave a riddle within a black hole on the other side of it if their intention was to save humanity. Couldn't they have been just a little bit more direct, if they can alter gravity on the micro, high resolution level. Come to think of it, if the point of the black hole was simply to house the library thing, why wasn't that simply out in plain view? Seems a lot more sensible than having to conjure up the circumstances whereby someone would think that ENTERING AND SURVIVING A BLACK HOLE WAS POSSIBLE, LET ALONE A GOOD IDEA?!? And wasn't that actually a worm-hole, since he was looking in on the room? why did the other one require an acid trip of a tunnel to get to the other side?  Why oh why is their only A SINGLE PERSON (caine) on earth working on that gravity equation? Oh, and then McConaughy's daughter, after 40+ years, which makes two. No MRIs and they whip up that space-ship (presumably one of many) in a few years. And suddenly have all that high-tech medicine, despite the lack of tomography. And cryogenics? And why are they tooling around Saturn 100 years after getting mcconaughy's message, instead going through the worm-hole to salvation, or even sending anyone else to help out Lonesome Anne?  Matt Damon and McConnaughy wander off ON FOOT on the glacier and yet it takes comparatively ages for the ship to JJET TO THEIR LOCATION. they must have been fit dudes to accomplish that distance on foot on that terrain. Infuriating. The best thing was the 'music', more accurately awesome, polyphonic blasts (I mean that in a good way). I know it made it hard to hear some of the dialog, but that wasn't such a bad thing."
2021.05.28,10,"One of the best Movies ever! The Story, the actors, the Effects, the Camera and all other things, simply wow!"
2023.03.04,10,I rewatched this after 7 years. The first time I watched this a lot of the scientific stuff went over my head (even though I have a minor in Chemistry). And I felt quite frustrated that I was missing the big picture thinking there were holes in the plot which turned out was caused by my lack of scientific knowledge. As I got older and my love for physics and astronomy grew I was determined to rewatch this movie so it would make sense. Watching simple yet informative You Tube videos which explained Einsteins Theory of Relativity along with multi dimensions helped me fill in some of plot holes. After seeing it again I was just wow. One of the best movies I have seen. Hands down.
2020.10.19,10,"There are countless reasons why I love to watch movies, but Interstellar always reminds me why I fell in love with cinema in the first place. There hasn't been a film which hit me as deeply as Interstellar. The story has so many layers to it and essential themes like the survival of our species, pioneering in order to sustain the human race, and ultimately: the importance of love to humankind. Since it is a Sci-Fi-film, I never expected it to be as emotional, philosophical and touching in its core. The most important message it wants to tell us is to grow beyond us and to face the challenges we are most afraid of. Furthermore, sometimes you have to sacrifice something in order to achieve your goals (Newton's third law). The cinematography is one of the most beautiful of all time which leaves you in awe, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is simple, yet absolutely breathtaking. All actors give great performances, especially Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, Mackenzie Foy as young Murph and Jessica Chastain as adult Murph. Christopher Nolan crafted something special with this film, invested a lot into research for scientific accuracy, which he used to show us never before seen images which are revolutionary and raise new standards for future space movies. A must watch!"
2020.09.09,10,"I went into Interstellar with high expectations due to the story concept and director Christopher Nolan's history of great films. I got the brilliant story and visual spectacle I was hoping for, but I didn't expect the gut wrenching emotions the movie would put me through. It's true that despite being a masterclass of visual effects and spud design, the emotions in the film and the incredibly talented actors that portray them are the main reason to watch this film. It is an unforgettable movie."
2022.11.15,10,"I sill don't get how Hans Zimmer didn't win the Oscar with those amazing Master-pieces that he made in the soundtracks. The Film is overall the best film in it's category, one of the best Sci-Fi films that touches your emotions and feelings, it's one of the most brilliant films that is made by Christopher Nolan, maybe it's his best. Watching this movie for more than once never gets boring you just figure out more hints and brilliance in directing and storyline. If you haven't seen this film yet, you're missing a lot. Cinematography and Graphics are on a whole other level. It's comforting to across a movie that doesn't really claim to have any of the answers, every time you watch it you just get more questions in your head."
2022.02.17,9,"Wow... Im blown away. It lures you in... you think 'okay this is silly', you think you are better than the movie. But then it hits you right in the back of your head.. You look confused.. The movie sneaked up all the way behind you and hits you in the head like you have never been hit before. Combine that with the absolutely brilliant soundtrack from the one and only 'Hans Zimmer' and you got yourself a literal banger. I cried. Not a little, a lot. Very cathartic."
2014.12.05,7,"CAUTION, SPOILERS AHEAD! In Rian Johnson's time travel caper, 'Looper', Old Joe says to Young Joe, 'I don't wanna talk about time travel s***. Cause if we start talking about it, then we're gonna be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws'. This certainly applies to Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster, 'Interstellar'. In fact, instead of wasting time and brain power trying to work out how Matthew McConaughey can possibly communicate with his future-past daughter through Morse code derived from a watches' hands, via plucking bands of color, while trapped in another dimension – or any of the thousands of baffling thoughts that inevitably come with the time travel paradox (or in this case, inter-dimensional travel), I'm just going to go right ahead and skip that aspect of the film in this review, sparing my poor head, and perhaps yours. Instead, I want to focus on Interstellar's biggest strength: the experience as a whole. Shot on 70mm IMAX film stock, the film is just flat out stunning. Shots are larger than life, every pore on the actors' faces can be seen, the slight grain and color timing of the print give a warmth to the cold film – something which Nolan's films generally lack. Coupled with Nolan's insistence on using practical effects over computer-generated imagery and Hans Zimmer's intense scoring reminiscent of Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey', helps create a simply breathtaking, visceral experience. The visual effects are on par with some of the greatest I've ever seen on film. Not once was I taken out of the film; I was grounded in it, everything looked and felt real. Director's need to take note: practical effects with dabs of CGI here and there when necessary look amazing, or in other words, stop relying on CGI. Clocking in at just under 180 minutes, potential viewers might find the lengthy film daunting; however, the film is surprisingly well paced, it doesn't plod or meander. I didn't find myself checking my watch or cellphone at any point hoping for it to end. And I couldn't imagine trimming it any further, in fact I hope there is an extended cut in the future to extend a few scenes in space to allow the viewer to take in just that little it more of the extraordinary view. Nolan casts a few of his usual bunch in supporting roles such as Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (pronounced as 'My Cocaine'), none of whom elevate above or beyond the material. They just are. Though Hathaway was especially bland, I felt nothing for her – which wasn't the best, as I'm sure Nolan wanted us to. She struggles to sink her teeth into (and perhaps make sense of) a few of the lines, while Michael Caine pulls a Morgan Freeman and plays his tired old self. It is Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain who steal the show, and I should note that Chastain is fast becoming one of the greatest working actresses today, while McConaughey proves 'The Mcconaissance' is still in full throttle, alright, alright, alright? My only issue with the film lies with Michael Caine's sudden death after revealing the realities of the mission to Chastain. I sat there during his final speech thinking 'please don't die, please don't die', but he did, and my eyes couldn't help but to roll back and view the dark recess at the back of my head. Perhaps the extent of the suspension of belief required for viewing is another niggle, but that is ever so slight. The science behind the film made sense when considering the plot, but when you start to pick it apart cracks begin to show and it almost comes undone, but I feel that it's easy to let go of this factor and just enjoy the film for what it is, a stunning and spectacular experience. Though not without fault, the sheer scope and ambition of the film should be applauded. It needs to be seen to be believed. Admittedly, I've never been a fan of Nolan's films, but he has knocked it out of the park with this one and almost converted me. The question cinema- goers are asking these days is, 'do I have to see this in the cinemas?' and the answer is yes, you do. Even if you have a shiny new curved television with all the bells and whistles, the experience would not be as grand. This is worth the trip. A solid 8/10 If you liked this review, check out more here: www.justathought.co"
2022.11.06,10,"I consider myself very lucky to be able to have watched this MASTERPIECE in a cinema screen when it came out. The experience is out of this world, visuals, emotions, music all over the place. This is Nolan's best work and one of the best movies EVER. Congrats to everyone involved in the making of this. Amazing acting, Matthew was so good. The music is an instant classic. I really don't understand some critics that found the movie bad and implausible an all these. It's a scifi after all. Its excellent in terms of being scientifically accurate and has a brilliant narrative and effective story-telling. Who cares if the last 20 minutes are ''implausible'' when you're filled with the emotions hit you so hard. Do yourselves a favor and go watch it in the biggest screen possible and with the best sound you can have to experience it."
2015.12.28,6,"I watched this on DVD. The first half of the movie seemed like it needed an intro as to why the world was so devastated. Also why there were no threat of violence from gangs hoarding all the resources like most other apocalypse movies? Nice human touch, but not realistic. We don't know anything about the planet except for the slice of life of a dozen people. What happened to the weather patterns? Strike one. How does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. Strike two. The middle of the movie was the best part. Their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. The ending with Morse communication was snake oil and mirrors. Where did that multi-dimensional structure come from? Seemed like it came from 2001 Space Odessey. Strike three. The plot leaps from grounded science to Twilight Zone too often for me. Before the movie I was wanting to give it a high grade, but I don't think I'll even watch it again. Anne Hathaway bumps it up a notch."
2014.11.09,5,"Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The 'Dust Bowl' effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many 'that wouldn't happen' moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive."
2016.01.22,10,"I am not sure if we fully understand the movie or if we should or if we can. Its just like watching a beautiful sunset. Slow, Beautiful, Inspiring and Philosophical. The sound and especially some times the lack of it in the space scenarios is amazing. The movie was used as a great canvas for Hans Zimer to unleash his raging musical art. I recommend watching the movie with an open mind and in an uninterrupted, high-definition format. Keep your questions to the end and then look into the IMDb forums if still unanswered. Some of the earlier scenes in the movie may not be as gripping to an extent that I wanted to take 1 or 2 stars off my review score , but they are necessary in building the characters and an in-depth plot."
2020.12.28,10,"This is truly a masterpiece in an era where movies are made just for special effects and mostly for teenagers. It isn't perfect of course, especially with all the technical data, but hey, this is not a documentary. And so giving it only 9 starts would be a shame."
2024.03.06,10,"Going to a film in a theater is an experience. Regardless if the film is good or bad, a masterpiece or a failure - when the lights go down - something magical occurs. The audience is taken to new places, they discover new ideas or feelings, and every few years or so, a film can shake your inner-being to your core. Interstellar shook my inner-being to my core. I'm not kidding, exaggerating, or being hyperbolic; this film put me in a state that can only be described as transcendent, religious even. Now, nearly one decade after it's theatrical release, and many rewatches later, it's still as transcendent as it ever was. Simultaneously combining Spielbergian warmth with Kubrickian opaque mystery; Christopher Nolan's magnum opus astonishingly tells a story of intimate love and connection set against a backdrop of vast discovery and uncertainty. Never losing sight of constant themes that interweave throughout, the film tells a story of potent beauty and understated clarity, culminating in a work that never lets go of its big heart and its wild ambition. All of the performances are spectacular, especially from Matthew McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. McConaughey, my favorite actor of all time, brings one of the finest performances in movie history, unleashing a sensational amount of emotion that is necessary for establishing the film's infinite core. The scenes with him and Foy are beautiful, sublime, and simply stupendous; mainly because of the underlying layers that widen in retrospect. Anne Hathaway quietly stuns, with a prime example being a monologue on love that had me quietly weep to myself. Nolans direction is beyond words. The wide-shots, the close-ups, the alien landscapes; the film is visually orgasmic. Trust me, you've never seen stars look so real. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is groundbreaking. We thought Wally Pfister will be missed, but he won't. The way the camera flows, combined with the slick editing by Lee Smith, makes up a visual EXPERIENCE that is easily the most visually stunning film EVER made. Yet, it's the addition of Hans Zimmer's soundtrack that elevates the film into the stratosphere of modern cinema. Instantly becoming my favorite soundtrack of all time, and definitely one of the finest ever produced; Zimmer's work here is utterly holy and divine. Pairing with the immaculate imagery, the film releases a poetic feeling of tenderness and sterile majesty; highlighting our insignificance in the universe but our determination to overcome our limitations. The story is the finest aspect of this breathtaking work. A journey of the most mind-blowing and impressive order; Christopher Nolan asks the audience to take a leap of faith to explore love, connection, intimacy, and the lengths we go for not just others, but all of humanity. It's all about a relationship between Father and Daughter. Nolan takes the most ambitious genre, hard science-fiction, and uses it to discuss why we love, and how love will get us further than anything else in our lives. It's wholly satisfying, pure, sweet, and stupendously emotional. Interstellar is a masterwork, a film of timeless beauty and endless innovation. It is my favorite film of all time, and I can see it being that way until I settle down for the long nap. A transcendent and moving experience, Interstellar is the finest film ever made."
2022.10.28,10,"From the first act itself, the movie takes you on an amazing and beautiful journey of emotions and intensity. I might have watched this movie quite late but it was and will always be my all time favorite. Cooper struggling to make a decision between his daughter and the world is portrayed so well without a whole bunch of dialogues. The characters are so amazing and you go on this amazing journey with Cooper and his team, that you almost feel like a part of the crew. The scene with Cooper trying to dock the ship with the music in the background is done so well. Each time I watch it, I clutch my seat in sheer intensity."
2019.09.07,10,This was a great movie and one that I wish there were more of. This movie had me thinking the whole time and that is what I loved. The balance between entertainment and brain shaking moments was perfect and is a film like no other. Great job to everyone who put this masterpiece together!
2021.06.05,10,Just watch the movie once you won't regret any second or minute given to the movie I've already watched it thrice Unlucky me couldn't watch in cinemas But trust me the fun of the movie is watching it alone on a good display and a good pair of headphones.
2021.06.18,7,"Rating: 7.3 This one is special have never seen a space movie so well connected before. The visuals were incredible but the movie falls short in explaining the origins of the conflict: why they ran out of food, as well as relying too heavily on quantum mechanics and theoretical fiction Cooper miraculously redocking to the broken endurance, cooper not being immediately ripped apart in the event horizon, the 5th dimension time stuff just so cooper could talk to his daughter, cooper somehow sending quantum data to his daughter in morse code, nobody looking for brand until cooper woke up ect.. The theme of the power of love was wildly cringeworthy but other than that good film."
2025.09.04,8,"'Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.' Interstellar is Nolan at his most ambitious, trying to wrestle with the biggest of questions, what place do we hold in the universe, and what would we sacrifice to keep love and our species alive across time and distance? At its heart, though, it's the story of a father and a daughter, and that thread between Coop and Murph is what gives the film its soul. Those early moments between them are easily my favorite part, warm and fragile in ways Nolan doesn't always allow himself to be. The film isn't without flaws. The way Coop's son is written feels like an afterthought, as if the script forgot he existed once the bond with Murph took center stage. The stacked cast also feels uneven, some characters, like Lithgow's, appear more as plot devices than real people. And the whole subplot with Damon's character never fully clicked for me, pulling me out instead of deepening the story. What sometimes frustrates me about Nolan is also what makes his work stand out. He insists on turning nearly every scene into something monumental, and in Interstellar that tendency sometimes borders on overblown. Yet even when the grandeur feels too much, there are moments so visually and emotionally striking that they carry you with them. The visuals are astonishing, from the vastness of space to the textures of each planet, and the sound and editing give the whole journey a rhythm that feels alive. Zimmer's score, built around that haunting organ, might be the most powerful of Nolan's collaborations. For me, Interstellar works best not as a perfect piece of science fiction, but as a meditation on time and love. When it leans into that, When Murph whispers across decades and Coop stares at the stars, it becomes something rare. Flawed, yes, but also deeply moving. A film that rages against the dying of the light."
2015.12.28,3,"This film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. The magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention (e.g. when is Matt Damon inserted into this?). Such a disappointment. I'm very pleased that I waited until this was available on streaming services. The beginning, while slow and lacking character development (and somewhat unbelievable), is interesting. The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to 'The Fifth Element' where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. I found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on IMDb after being released over 1 year ago! As a scientist/engineer, I wanted to enjoy this film. I was woefully disappointed. For anyone interested, I'd watch The Martian long before watching this drivel. I'm shocked that this is #29 in IMDb's 'Top Rated Movies', how did that happen? Brings into question how reliable IMDb really is with respect to objective movie reviews."
2020.08.28,10,I will always regret that I could not see this film in the cinema
2019.09.27,10,Probably the best movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life
2022.08.17,10,"The film starts slowly, but it's not boring. Stability and uniqueness, I do feel like this movie could be like last year's Sandra Bullock and George Clooney blockbuster Gravity. As time goes by, I can feel the importance of time, which makes my prejudice gradually disappear. With twists and turns, but without straining the brain, it does put emotion and adventure together."
2021.12.09,10,"I missed this when it was released in the cinema, assuming it was a run of the mill space movie. So sad that I never saw this on the big screen. When I finally got around to watching it, boy was my mind blown, the movie is practically perfect. It has every element you could want, it's treats you like an intelligent person when explaining the scientific theories and you feel intelligent understanding them. The acting is incredible and the score just superb. The level of depth this film has really has an affect on you for a long time afterwards. It will take an emotional toll on you so be prepared to have a good cry. This is a movie you definitely need to sit down, and pay attention to while watching and I guarantee you will be so rewarded for your efforts. In my top 5 favorite movies of all time."
2021.11.28,10,I was enjoying this movie so much that I never wanted this movie to get finished. This is and always will be the best Sci-fi movie ever created. I watched this movie today ( 28/11/2021 ) but this movie came in 2014 and now I'm frustrated that why I didn't watched this masterpiece that time.
2018.12.19,6,"In the near future, the planet Earth is disintegrating environmentally. A team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where Earth's remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive. The first half of the film is fascinating. It has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and over-population. There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either. The second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized. The movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more."
2022.11.29,10,"Interstellar is a near perfect masterpiece. Although the run time can make the film feel a little too long at points and the ending is also slightly drawn out, the film makes up for these flaws and shows why Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors and storytellers of this generation. The ideas in the film are very intriguing and make you think for hours after you first view it. Upon rewatch the film becomes even more fascinating because of all the things you might have missed the first time through. The emotion showed throughout the film also improves the story greatly. The stakes of what they are trying to accomplish are shown with this emotion with Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway standing out with their stellar performances. But, probably the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and visuals. The visuals are some of the best of any film ever created and are something that really impacts you. So, Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, although with some minor flaws, blew me away with its story, concept, cinematography and exceptional visuals."
2015.12.28,6,"Yes, it has an awesome photography. Yes, it is plenty of awesome actors. And yes, it has a pleasant way of using multidimensional physics. But, for Christ's sake, did they actually needed a 169 minutes long space movie for stating that 'Love is a very powerful force!'? With all the hype and the claims of profoundness I've expected something that actually bore a thousand questions to my mind, kept me mentally awake for days, not a movie in which the most difficult concept to understand is 4-dimensional physics. Sadly this wasn't the case."
2014.11.09,1,"This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey?  Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of 'hard' science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why. Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that 'love is the most important thing in the world'. Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this?  By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences... This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3... The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy... The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word 'magic' (interchangeable with 'nonsense') comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here... The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him. Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all."
2021.02.26,9,"Holy molly...What just happened.... Interstellar is an incredible movie with some of Mathew McConaughey's best work ever. They affects were outstanding, the science was utterly confusing, which is a good thing. I like NOT knowing everything about the science in sci fi movies. It makes the movie more effective. The music in this movie was almost perfect to the story. I don't think there is anything majorly wrong with this movie. The docking scene in this movie was I think the best docking scene out of any movie. This movie will go down in history for being in the top 3 best sci fi movies ever. Good job. :) This is in my top 4 for best movies i have ever scene."
2025.01.02,10,"I can't believe how this film makes me feel and I have watched it at least five times. This movie should be considered one of the best if not, the absolute best movie ever produced. It took me through feelings I didn't know I had in my old sour age! Humanity can be brutal and beautiful. The way it makes you feel as if you're there having this experience with these characters. I've never really reviewed anything so I probably sound uneducated compared to professionals. I wish I could have first experienced this at a theatre especially imax. Anyway hope you read my thoughts and it helps you decide to watch for your first time."
2024.08.17,10,A movie who will become buried inside your head. It starts with being a little confusing but this movie will test your focus and your ability to stay focused and keep your concentration if I could I would watch it again you may see it last a little over 2 hours but not 2 hours you'll regret. This is what I would call a movie not some kind of joke produced show this is quality all way through and if you're reading this and not knowing if you should watch it I can almost guarantee you that you'll like it and one day maybe this movie will be gone and you will regret not having watched it watch it.
2022.02.19,10,"The first time I watched this film I felt extremely underwhelmed. It was boring, dragged out, and too confusing, and I stopped watching before the 3rd act (which Imo is the best act). Maybe 2 months ago I rewatched it, thought I would give it another chance, and it was soooooooooooooooooooo good! The performances were great, the story made sense, and it was one of the only films where I was completely immersed to the screen (along with Jurassic Park, Aliens. 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring). The visual effects are extremely good, and the writing was great. I felt that the second act was a bit flawed in terms of scripting and directing (imo the weakest of the 3 acts), but is still fantastic nonetheless. Interstellar manages to make you completely immersed into the screen, which only very few films can do. This film truly shows the genius of Nolan making him my second favourite director of all time (favorite being Spielberg). Hands down one of my top 5 films. Hands down the best Christopher Nolan film in my humble opinion (The Dark Knight being a close second). One of the greatest-epic of all time, hands down."
2021.02.03,10,The Nolan brothers have made a piece of history. That's all i can say to help you understand how extremely well done this movie is.
2021.05.27,10,One of the best movies I've seen. A masterpiece from every angle. I never get tired of watching it.
2015.09.11,6,"Interstellar as a movie wasn't bad at all. My only problem with the movie was how the story conveyed the perspective of the gloominess and the extended boring and silent moments that made it less interesting. Another problem was the ending, it was totally unexplainable and lame. So 'why' do such a great movie, then ruin it with such unnecessary strange anonymous ending with Anne Hathaway living alone in a seemingly depressed way, while Matthew Mcconaughey is living in another spiral world and all of a sudden: The End?! Unless there's a sequel, thats unacceptable.  I know that some may enjoy the visuals and the idea of the after world, but thats simply letting the viewer feel in some way empty and kind of regret watching a movie that may be overrated 'a bit' due to the scenes I have mentioned before."
2023.12.14,10,"At first, I thought it was an overrated movie but when I came to watch this masterpiece I was flabbergasted! I FELT IN SO MUCH OF DIFFERENT STAGE OF EMOTION. THE CASTS WERE GREAT AND THE FLOW OF THE MOVIE AND THE TWIST, ITS BEAUTIFUL, IT IS A LOT TO TAKE BUT A LOT TO TAKE A MOMENT OF. A MUST WATCH MOVIE! I would have never imagined on how the story goes, I thought of it as a typical scientific movie only but never have I ever imagined the story behind will take me to different dimension of emotions. More than excellent and amazingly made, I could say. This deserved it's hype and love more than ever!"
2014.12.19,7,"I will begin with the bottom line - yes, the movie is good, it does give you an enjoyable movie experience, and yes you should watch it. And yet, it does not worth it's rate of 9/10. The movie itself is pretty normal with regular scenes and some few scenes which made people really like the movie. These scenes are rather few in number, but are placed in strategic times in the movie, giving it its peaks at the exact time you need it. What most people forget is that the entire movie up to these scenes is just a regular every day science fiction movie. I think everyone is so praising it because their friends are saying it who heard it from their friends and so on... I hope you enjoy the movie but don't be blinded by what other people think of this movie."
2014.11.14,1,"I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a perfect movie, really! Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit for me! I had really high expectations. For the entire movie I was feeling like: 'the best part of the movie should soon', but never came. I had hard time understanding what was really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion, galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us. SPOILERS AHEAD Maybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie, I failed.  What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight, totally no sense. Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did. This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally confusing, too much cliché. Watch it but don't have high expectations as me, you will be disappointed."
2023.05.01,10,"This is probably my favourite movie of all time. Not only is it my favourite movie, it's also the best space movie. I watch it every year in April around my birthday, and this year was no exception. I have seen it eight times now and it is still fantastic. I get chills and I cry every time. The acting is phenomenal, and Matthew McConaughey is one of my favourite actors. The story is well-written and it also raises so many questions about space and our place in it. The pacing is perfect. The movie gets more and more interesting and exciting by every minute, and there are a lot of minutes in this movie, 169 minutes of goosebumps! It has one of the best endings I have ever seen in a movie. It's so emotional. The first time I saw this movie in the theaters, my mind got completely blown away. If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan and interested in space, you have to see this movie! 11/10!"
2021.11.26,10,"First off, I must apologize for the morbid caption. But the truth is this movie was not only a masterpiece in sci-fi cinema, but it was a masterpiece as a movie in it's own right. I am writing this review in November 2021 having just finished Interstellar again. I believe this is my 3rd watch. I am one who likes to savor movies and take my time to dissect every angle; and even now, this movie still stands the test of time and will for many years to come. The combination of Zimmer's score and Christopher Nolan's direction/story telling was just a match made in heaven. Everything was beautiful crafted, well paced and we'll delivered. The score will haunt you long after you're done watching this. Masterpiece as a word doesn't do this movie Justice. Death we know is inevitable for everyone but while you are here, watch this movie. You will be glad you did. As a word of advice try to avoid spoilers. A perfect 10/10 for me."
2022.07.04,10,"Time can stretch and fold, but it can't go back. It was so beautiful, so powerful, it took my breath away. But everything is preordained, and the survival of civilization depends on the tacit understanding between father and daughter, and that doesn't move me."
2025.10.30,10,"It reminds you of what creativity is. You don't see anything unique in movies anymore, they all look the same and become boring. Even in some very good movies of the past five years , you know what you're going to see and how they're going to end. The interstellar It's an unforgettable film and I can truly say, even though I was the last to see it, it was still worth it in 2025 and I can imagine how much of a hit it was when it was released in 2014. I don't think there will ever be such unique films again. Hans Zimmer's music, as you know, is fantastic. I've heard it many times before I saw the movie, and I'm sorry I saw Interstellar late. I was little when it came out. All I have to say is that we should respect these films. Unfortunately, in my generation, few of us respect them."
2022.05.19,10,"Christopher Nolan dives into the human desire for survival, with pioneering performances by Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway. Interconnected with astrophysics and astrobiology, Interstellar provides a grounded science-fiction approach to the exploration of space. Brilliant dialogue, heartfelt themes, and a beautiful orchestral arrangement by Hans Zimmer drive this visually stunning movie."
2015.10.24,6,"This film was actually not as bad as some of the director's other flops, having some emotional moments and one interesting character that was Murphy, being decently casted. The relationship between the father and his daughter had the entire film afloat and kept me going despite its many flaws.  The issues with this film are typical Nolan: first of all, repeatedly bad casting. During the first 20 minutes I was still trying to get over mcconaughey being an Astronaut. You could at least try to get rid of the heavy cowboy accent... Then, every scene is dragged over half an hour for no reason. You can take a nap occasionally and check in to see what's changed. Is mcconaughey back home yet? No? OK. Then you have the music. Goodness, WHAT? IT'S TOO LOUD I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! Some sound check would've been nice. In addition, some of the action scenes were completely out of sync with the music score. Then you blink and Matt Damon is suddenly in the movie. What is Damon doing here, looking very old... Wait what is happening now... Is he gone? OK. Then the movie turns to 2001 Kubrick and I wonder if mcconaughey is going to turn into a baby. Thankfully he didn't. Finally, if you made it this far, you get some closure with mcconaughey and his daughter. Worth the wait? If you take many breaks and have a free afternoon, why not."
2021.12.31,10,"I'm not a big fan of movies as a whole but when one shines through you just know its exceptional. This is now my favorite movie of all time and it truly deserves it. From the beginning I was gripped, introduced to a likeable cast of characters placed into an interesting reality that compelled you right through. From the get go, the writers allow us to naturally connect with the characters. We see an interesting take on the father-daughter dynamic and as the story continues I balled my heart eyes especially when Cooper failed to fulfil his promise. A great mix of a plot and emotional connection. Through out the movie I was anxious of what would happen next, often seeing illogical reasonings behind things I thought the movie would collapse into itself. I was wrong. With each passing minute, the inner conflict of the characters along with the soundtrack that fits perfectly with each of the scenes allowed for a well executed plot. Then the highest high of the movie: The scene where Cooper enters the black hole is one of the best scenes I've ever experiences. I had chills through my whole body the whole time. That is when I knew this is cinema at its peak. I will await a moment that will surpass this, as I watch more movies but for now all I have to say is: Peak cinema."
2019.02.12,6,"Love saved the universe. Love. I'm fine with the idea of love being a powerful emotion, but as a sci-fi, especially a quite serious one with well-respected scientist as it's scientific advisor, it is quite cringy to have personal love as core of human survival in a cruel universe."
2014.11.14,1,"This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."
2021.11.18,10,"People who score this below a 9 clearly don't understand the movie , if you think it's science fiction then you are wrong. Movie experts trying to find plot holes.... Are probably the same people who don't get vaxed."
2022.11.26,10,"This film is definitely a masterpiece, where each of the elements converge in a masterful way. The music, the actors performances, the visual and digital effects are premium, everything, absolutely everything is carefully constructed. The way that story surrounds you at the moment you start to comprehend it. Even you believe everthing that is happening in front of you, the places are beauty, the production design is so clean, everything in this film is perfect. We can fall in love the physics and try to learn for find another solution to the main plot. I still feel the tears run down my face, great movie."
2019.09.27,10,"So many feelings throughout this movie...The time concept was especially mind-breaking. Wonderfully written -- and finally not a trace of unnecessary romance to be found! This film kept my attention the whole time, I was hesitant to even move during some parts. Amazing soundtrack and visuals. 10/10"
2021.03.11,10,"I don't know how many times I've seen this film now, partially or in full. Tonight I flicked the channel over and there it was, at the docking scene.... 'It's not possible.' : 'No, it's necessary.'.... I need to go to bed but how can I even though I have a copy I can watch any time? This film is by far one of the greatest I have watched. It just does something for me, I love my sci-fi, that helps. I'm not a film critic, I'm not able to analyse a film to depth of someone qualified to do so by title, but I love my films and I love being immersed in something that surrounds you entirely. The score (listen to Hans Zimmer's soundtrack on its own, track 8.... mountains...), the cinematography, the worlds created, the scenes on the planets, the black hole, the seemingly interlinked relationship between the earth story and the space story, and most of all, the homage to Arthur C Clarke. I'm not sure why he isn't referenced or out there in discussions that I can find, but a large part of this film was written by him (indirectly!), anyone who's read Odyssey or Rama will know this. What Christopher Nolan has done to make this his is amazing in its own right. I know there are some critics, but for me, this film was 46 years in the making and I can only thank Clarke and Nolan for it."
2023.01.07,9,"The story of the film is very touching. If we remove the music from the movie, it will still be a good movie, even a better movie, maybe even a weak point. Well now if we remove the music we see that it is longer. And maybe it will be boring for the audience who likes this big movie several times. The final sequence of the film turns into a package full of long shots. Such a show is repeated in different parts of the film. Even in the views we have from space. Nolan sprinkles a silver and gold color on these shots. Men in spacesuits look much bigger than normal. Matt Damon is not believable enough. But it is good. The sequences size are too long. Nolan tries to make it bearable with music, but he doesn't succeed. I am not against this. But this work also requires a slower rhythm. The pictures are very beautiful. And they often don't look like promotional teasers..."
2021.05.25,10,This movie made me think that there are some directors who are talented to a different extent.
2015.01.24,7,"If you deconstruct the movie then most of its pieces are great in their own way (visuals, music score, casting, acting, story, etc), but the problem for me is that the pieces don't fit together and even overload the whole thing in a baroque-esque way. I like it simpler, but I can enjoy more elaborate movies, though, Nolan's MO is just so recognizable that you can't help to identify the issues while you are watching. His opulent screenplays paired with stunning visuals and grandiose music scores push the inconsistent characters in the background and the plot is kept ambiguous enough to never fully commit to one story and Interstellar is no different. Still it also had a few things to it I liked, for instance, the story concept itself or omitting sound effects in space scenes (like it would be in a real vacuum) or touching on a few political topics with current relevance. So all in all, it's worth watching if you have 3 hours to spare."
2020.10.11,10,Never saw my future to be presented in such a realistic way... just awesome movie.
2014.11.12,6,"OK, so I had the great good fortune to see Kubrick's '2001' when it first came out, and you didn't: so this is what 50 years of CGI has brought us. Everything is possible technically so nothing can astonish us anymore, and this derivative forced march tries to bludgeon us into submission with blatant theft from Ken Burns' Dust Bowl to maudlin appeals to the emotion of loss of children or parents to science gibberish that makes our heads hurt. At least 60s hippies had pot to explain their reaction to 2001, while you could spend an evening of Trivial Pursuit listing all the pop movies from which this one steals--circular space station on which we now live, check; secretive but benevolent NASA, check; suspiciously solicitous robots, check; crazed astronauts, check, trippy special effects, check. And if you want to see whom our hotshot Lincoln pitchman is trying to channel, check out Sam Sheppard as Chuck Yeager in 'The Right Stuff.' Just because you never saw or have forgotten the pioneers, doesn't mean the latest blockbuster is the last word in genius. Ask yourself: 50 years from now, will you remember seeing this the way people remember first seeing '2001' or even 'Star Wars?' Thought so."
2014.11.10,1,"In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance. Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics, unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression.  Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter, older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting. The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two other guys add to the story? Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole, in 'another galaxy' seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in a US interstate highway.  Why would a director hire a 'Black-Hole-World-Expert' as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge. Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message: Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity theory to common movie goers, or the power of love. Each of them bold and superficial."
2023.12.17,10,"Possibly Nolan's finest. The film lives with me forever. It's so much more than a space movie. A film about love, about how insignificant and fragile we are, yet beautiful and capable of magical things. It has moments of joy, excitement, despair. The soundtrack is timeless, how Nolan has the vision to create something like this, which resonates on so many levels I will never understand.he simply is a genius, and Hans zimmers score matches his genius to perfection. I look forward to the day when my second child is old enough to watch this film with me, the reason being they will finally learn what they mean to me. Our child is called Murph."
2019.01.15,8,"I really liked the idea and the plot full of unexpected points and developments. Especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. I don't give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant, like in other Nolan's movies."
2022.07.28,9,"Interstellar is a science fiction movie about a team of astronauts who journey through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. Director Christopher Nolan shows us a dystopian world where dust storms have destroyed Earth's crops. The situation is so bad that the government decides that mankind needs a new home among the stars. Matthew McConaughey plays the leading role as the brave astronaut chosen to save mankind. One of the best movie ever made, must watch."
2022.03.28,10,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director. He made such a perfect job at this movie. You will find every feeling you wanted at this movie except love. Anyway, you will love this movie. *This review will be updated."
2021.09.18,10,When i watched this gem for the first time i watched it again the same day because i was like woow what was that...complete satisfaction and confusion Science and Love mixed together and this concentrated mixture will give you an ultimate feeling.
2020.12.29,10,"Worth watching a million times. Each time you watch it's a new movies. It is shot as a documentary Every time when i watch the movie, the emotions connects within me at a deeper level which is just mind-blowing. The spectacular Screenplay from the Nolan brothers along with Han Zimmer's Music makes it a masterpiece. The screenplay itself has many layers to it. Film has beautifully portrayed the relationship b/w a man & his daughter as she grows up. My only regret is not being able to watch this movie with all its spectacle in pure 70mm IMAX. Last scenes makes even the strongest of minds to cry."
2020.07.26,7,"I gave it a 7, because I find some of the relationship dynamics in the movie to be an unnecessary irritation. The movie could have been a masterpiece without the histrionics. Maybe they just didn't ring true, or maybe they didn't add much to the story. Maybe (in the case of the daughter) it was just so much negative-feeling bunk that really distracted. It's too damned bad. This is a large-canvas film and it was diminished. I *think* that's because instead of infusing our characters with some nobility, we were treated to whining, and supposed realistic human behaviour. I gotta say, if you're aiming high, don't sabotage your attempt with the low human characteristics. Give us something to feel good about. This movie seems to be about people attaining their goal despite being 'merely human'. Darned shame, wasted opportunity. I felt irritated often, throughout the movie and didn't feel like cheering, at the end. Great cast, though. Even Matthew McConaughey had his more irritating acting twitches reigned in by Christopher Nolan's directing skill."
2022.12.09,10,"Loving how they are telling the story about how signs could be a way for the other side to communicate with us here on earth, beautiful music and fantastic acting I was struck by how interesting ideas they have presented in this movie and I feel there is many layers to the film. What happens when we die and if we do not age when we are on different planets, what happens to us and to our loved ones that are on earth, it made me think of my father who has passed away, and my wish to communicate with him, I like the music and soundscapes that they are adding onto the visual scenes, it makes it all more real."
2020.06.05,7,Interstellar good film but last scene is stupid i dont understand but i like it of course watch this movie
2015.08.24,4,"A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called 'Cloud Atlas.' Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project. Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a 'wormhole' near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another. The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what 'Interstellar' is all about. After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend 'Interstellar.' But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent 'Gravity,' 'Interstellar' is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters. Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity – and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original 'Star Trek' series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish.  Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior 'Gravity' last year, 'Interstellar' pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in '2001: A Space Odyssey,' Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. 'Gravity' was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. 'Interstellar' is blaring and assiduous – like a semi-serious 'Star Wars' crossed with the garbage science of 'Star Trek.' 'Interstellar' is an old-fashioned Saturday matinée, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. 'Interstellar' is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two.  And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity."
2021.12.10,10,"Oh my goodness! What an incredible film! I am a pretty big fan of Nolan's works; this is probably my favorite one (yes, better than Inception and Dark Knight). I enjoyed just about everything in this movie: the characters, the plot, the filming, the intensity, the emotion, the score and the visuals were all absolutely stellar. They were all very spectacularly made. It was just a movie that I could just sit back relax and watch and not search for every incorrect miniscule detail. Now it probably isn't the most interesting thing for kids, and the ending makes a perfect storyline go a little wonky. A small understanding of space time goes a long way into understanding this movie so I get where some people are coming from. But seriously please go watch this movie it is definitely one of the best ever made."
2021.12.17,10,This movie made me think of a different dimension. After watching this movie I felt a lot of things about the universe and the existence. And also showed the value of farmer in our future for living on this earth.
2022.07.04,10,I have a weird routine of watching this movie every year and I am still nuts about this movie. The concept of time travel and gravity have always boggled us. What if all of it is real? What if part of the movie is non-fiction?
2022.03.03,10,"It's called Nolan's movie it's been a great movie since the trailer came out. Personally, I've watched almost every Nolan movie and enjoyed every single one I've ever seen because I like sci-fi movies, space makes me like interstellar, and in movies there are many aspects of interpersonal relationships but it's the uncomplicated relationship that keeps the movie's main focus on science. The concept of the movie is quite different from the others that I've ever seen. The relationship between time, black holes, technology of the future. It's something I never thought it would have but it is a science that is not so complicated that it makes people look confused. The story is explained and contributed to the audience to think for themselves. The movie tells of a world inhospitable due to plant diseases. Force former NASA astronaut Cooper to explore new stars to keep humanity alive. In this movie I loved the scene where a group of astronauts landed on a planet for about half an hour but when they come back the earth has been passed for many years. I find it very interesting to play science with time because there is such a thing in the real world and the scene where Cooper falls into a black hole I feel sparkling. Although in fact we don't know exactly what will happen if we enter a black hole. All of this makes it my favorite sci-fi movie of the year and I'll go back and watch it often. Anyone who is worried that they will be confused by the story or not understand can watch it at all because the texture is not complicated and when solving the clue, everyone will feel very sparkling eyes. I want everyone to open their minds and this movie is sure to be a sci-fi movie that's in everyone's heart."
2018.10.28,10,"A thought provoking emotional roller-coaster. McConaughey is superb. If you like sci-fi and know how to invest emotionally in a movie - give it a spin. I can guarantee that, even if you don't love it, you'll finish with an appreciation for the scope of what it tries to achieve."
2021.05.29,9,You should watch this movie with it's original sound to get the movie experience.
2019.12.18,6,"I'm going to admit I'm not the biggest fan of Nolan's work. I don't consider him a bad director, it's just his kind of work it's not for me. Interstellar is not an exception. Continuing in Nolan's line, the movie has a long, long introduccion. Yeah, that's not necessary bad, but the problem is you could quit 20 minutes and it wouldn't affect the main characters. Of course, you must to know what you have to dispense. You can see a little poetry in McConaughey's character. As the movies moves on, the character gets tired and so do the actor. Not something bad, even it can be very cool for someone, but I just don't like to see Matthew tired of acting in some scenes in the second but especially in the third. You'll see I'm not criticizing bad things. I'm just saying things that I don't personally like, so it's my point of view. Sometimes the movie tries to blow your mind. And sometimes It makes it. For example, with the last scenes. So, what's my point? My point is that if you're a Nolan fan, go and see the movie. If you like some space misteries like my case well... maybe you don't get as much as you want. This is just a Nolan movie. And this is just my opinion."
2015.03.17,10,"This is one of the best of Nolan's, and you could say one of the best movies that ever came out. You can bet on that! I see this movie as his passion, just like his other movies such as 'Inception', 'The Following', 'Memento'-of courses is a must, his 'Batman'-series. It creates a visual awe, and you find it a complete movie. The science explained here, for example - the black hole and the worm hole, are astounding and visually amazing ... just amazing! The humanity explained here, the suspense that comes till the end, the crops shown, the gravity, astounding and astounding and 'm still in awe after watching this movie.I don't wanna spoil by saying the rest of the story (lol). Just watch it, this is a must watch for everyone."
2018.05.21,7,"Well, it did go on too long, but I enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. It dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. I also didn't think it had an ending. It kind of stopped."
2023.06.24,5,"'Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.' Void. Then, as the monologue continues, the void is filled with cringe. 'Oh, Nolan', I think to myself. 'Will you ever be able not to take gigantic resources as means to tell over-complicated, spectacle-centered stories that lack emotion?'. But of course, these thoughts probably won't reach Nolan anytime soon, and my internal monologue will only be shared with you guys. Let's get into it. Interstellar is a 2014 film, directed by the beloved and critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan. The movie follows a group of astronauts on a race against time to save humanity from extinction, looking for a new home planet for our race. Apropos a race against time, time has a lot of meaning in this film - a foreboding, looming presence that you fight against, a sacrifice you make, your one-way ticket to the end of everything you know. At least, this is what the film is trying to communicate. Nolan, who has delivered great material in the past (as of the time I'm writing this review, Memento is in my top 15 films of all time) but also lacking-in-emotion, over-complicated stuff (The Prestige being a prime example of that, and I think I might've been a little soft giving score to this film). I recommend reading my review to The Prestige for more insight about the way Nolan approaches cinema, but in short, I think that Nolan's biggest problem is looking at cinema as if it was a magic trick, as if the only thing that matters is to surprise and amaze. His way of doing that is turning to spectacles, to complicated concepts with cool visuals, but by doing so he often compromises the emotional aspect of the film, and the flow of the story, too. In this case, I feel like most aspects of the film are just okay, just there to support those massive moments regarding time and space. The amount of work going into some of the visuals is truly magnificent, but I feel like I can't be moved by this film, not really. The characters are far from being three dimensional or interesting, only managing to be just a little above the bare minimum needed to sustain the plot. The dialogue is nothing more than okay - decent at its best moments, cringe-worthy at its worst. I mean, the only thing truly working here is the film's way with the most epic moments of the story, the moments that make you feel how powerless, how small humans are in comparison to the universe in general. I'll also admit that the pacing felt much worse on first watch, when so much of the film went on and on about scientific terms and laws of physics (the dialogue felt super forced here) and then tried to push this half-baked philosophy about the importance of love (which was forced, too, and definitely felt like Nolan's poor attempt in finding an excuse to this film's concept) that I felt like it just crawled sometimes. On rewatch you know what to expect, and I could let myself enjoy the more fun moments, the grand moments, easing into the spectacle as much as I could. Still - spectacle doesn't compensate for the dryness of anything else. This is maybe to worst thing about this film - it thinks it's deep or smart when it isn't, not at all. The grandest moments work best, the 'philosophical' moments or the moments in which the film tries to outsmart the viewer...well, this is Nolan's biggest weakness as a director. It's not horrible, but it's disappointing in its utter mediocrity. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one."
2025.08.20,10,"'Interstellar' is not just another movie that is 'really' good. It is a masterpiece of cinema with insane visuals and a plot that gives you a feeling that you can't really explain, something that isn't with regular movies, it gives you a kind of hope. The most psychological film in existence; you really have to think about it in order to feel the sheer impact this movie brings. You can't say that this is 'a good movie' you have to rewatch it and think about it hard. Not only is the movie a masterpiece, the visuals are as well. The black hole scenes and the last planet they go to are such iconic and stunning things to experience and watch. The haters will say things like, and I quote, 'It's okay when they talk pseudo scientific goobleygook when it's Star Trek because they have pointy ears.' People who say that have no reason to. Like I said, you have to really think about it. In comparison to other top Christopher Nolan movies like 'The Dark Knight' or 'Inception', I can reasonably say that this is his best movie. 'The Dark Knight' I was biased to because I don't really like superhero movies. 'Inception' was also really good, but it didn't give me the same rush as 'Interstellar' because unlike 'Interstellar', it's not scientifically accurate. That's also a reason I love 'Interstellar'. Everything that happens in that movie could actually happen. Well, my yapping is over. You can tell that 'Interstellar' is my favorite movie by miles. Before I close out my review, I will say this. 'Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'"
2022.08.16,10,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best science fiction films ever made. Although the feelings of the father and daughter play and did not move me, but gorgeous space let me fascinated."
2022.12.05,10,"Just rewatched this absolute masterpiece in cinma and god what an experience, the only question while I'm watching, how nolan did this movie. Imo if there's any show could be perfect and almost had no mistakes I'd gladly say it's interstellar, no other show did what interstellar did to me, full of emotions that can do deep into your hart and your felling, great soundtracks and one of the best soundtracks of all time, touching stories, fantastic acting, perfect end which has lots of meaning.. I laughed I cried I smiled I had lots of different feelings but the only feeling that I know for sure after this rewatch is interstellar is the greatest of all time."
2015.03.18,10,"I have to be honest when I saw the trailer I thought the film would be very monotonous so I was wonder if I would watch the film, eventually I am started to watch the movie, right from the first minute I thought it was really a great movie, not only because I am super interested in what plays in space and I love very much adventure films, but also because it's a bit the real life of an astronaut describes, the say goodbye to your family for example, and not being able to promise when you come back and if you come back at all, also I found that the film contained a lot of variety. and by that I mean that there is always a different kind of problem came, or the planet was not viable or the spaceship went piece, I thought it was really super that they have made, almost 3 hours full of excitement at the last 50 minutes it was really kind of mind f*ck because I didn't know how it could be that he was in a 5 dimensional space but good in other words, I found a SUPER movie and I really hope there is a interstellar 2 comes!!!"
2023.11.06,10,"'Interstellar' proves that science fiction can be packed with not only visual effects, but also deep thought. The film boldly tackles scientific concepts and concepts. It conveys complex topics such as the bending effects of time and the theory of relativity to the audience in an understandable way. However, 'Interstellar' is not only a scientific lesson but also an emotional journey. The main character Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) relationship with his family and his bond with his daughter Murph (played by Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn) are touched upon touchingly throughout the film. This makes the film not just brain-burning sci-fi, but a story imbued with universal themes such as human togetherness, sacrifice and love. Visually, 'Interstellar' delivers breathtaking scenes. Journeys into deep space and alien planets create unforgettable moments in cinema history. Hans Zimmer's music makes the film even more impressive. In conclusion, 'Interstellar' is a masterpiece of both science fiction and cinematic art. Christopher Nolan's directorial talents, the performances of the cast, and the deep themes covered in the film offer viewers an unforgettable experience. After watching this movie, you may start thinking about the secrets of the universe."
2022.11.13,10,"Interstellar is a movie that evokes instant wonder and hope within us all. For me this film, along with its stand out cast - especially Mathew and Anne - is a spectacle for the ages... the plot, the cinematography and not to mention music master Hans Zimmer's 'out of this world' film scores - the film just perfect. Every single time I hear the film's soundtrack I get instant goosebumps. My entire life I have been absolutely fascinated by space and this film only made me even more fascinated. Like any Christopher Nolan film this movie is guaranteed to have you intrigued from start to finish and this ending is one of my absolute favourites. If you are up for a movie that will leave you mesmerised this is the film for you. Interstellar will always be a favourite for me."
2014.12.03,6,"I found this movie slow and tedious in the first 20 minutes or so and at times during the rest of the movie. I also thought the last quarter or so of the film was bizarre. As for the soundtrack, nothing special. I did appreciate that a lot of philosophical questions arise as one watches this movie regarding humans place in the universe and the physical size of the universe and time. On the other hand, I also had the feeling that I was watching an updated version of '2001, A Space Odyssey' particularly with the sequence through the wormhole in this movie versus the Stargate in 2001. Also the similarity of the rectangular shapes of the robots to the obelisk, and a few other minor similarities.  All in all, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great, and probably will not watch it again unlike some other sci-fi movies including the aforementioned '2001, A Space Odyssey'."
2022.11.15,10,"I find myself watching this film atleast once a year since it came out, and every time I'm blown away by it. I used to be a HUGE movie junkie, watching atleast 2 movies every single day but as my life has gotten busier I've migrated over to YouTube the home of short attention spans. Nowadays I maybe watch 2 or 3 movies a month and rarely watch something I've seen before but this here is the kind of movie that deserves a rewatch, and another and another. If you've never seen this, which would be weird since it came out almost 9 years ago, then you are in for a treat, granted it will be a bit of a depressing treat but a treat none the less."
2014.12.24,7,"Interstellar is an interesting, thoughtful science fiction film with a good cast. It depicts a near future where an environmental disaster has sent Earth into an irreversible decline, forcing humanity to seek a new home in another galaxy. Although it is not as good as Christopher Nolan's other work, it still rises above most other blockbuster, high budget sci-fi. A number of factors make Interstellar better than average. First of all, it avoids the clichéd film apocalypse with lots of CGI explosions and a central villain. In this movie, the world dies not with a bang, but a whimper as our food crops gradually die out. It also gives interesting consideration to the social effects of such a catastrophe. More importantly, it treats the audience as at least somewhat intelligent. Although I'm certain Neil DeGrasse Tyson could pick it apart on Twitter if he so desired, the film attempts to be somewhat scientifically plausible, incorporating relativity theory and even a mathematical equation as major plot points. It's disturbingly rare for movies in recent years to aim at an intelligence level above that of a thirteen year old. The film also benefits from good designs of its space ships and robots. The robots deserve particular mention. Rather than the typical humanoid looking designs, the filmmakers created a genuinely original, even plausible robot. The main weak point in the film is that it tries to insert too optimistic an ending, when the story really wasn't building to one. Nevertheless, it is well worth watching."
2015.03.21,1,"its not a science fiction movie - its , um, i really don't know how to classify it other than its full of itself. I've watched every science fiction show/movie out there and if you're like me you will be mad after watching this movie. you can make a movie if your premise is right, for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a 'chance' at making a half decent science fiction movie. you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible. well w/interstellar they don't even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence. if you like star trek(any of them, TV spin offs or movies), star wars, Babylon 5, battle star, doctor who(old or new), and even 2001 Space Odyssey(boring but well made considering when it was made), take my advice and stay away, you will loose 3hrs of your life. the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no sense."
2024.04.09,10,"One of the best movies ever. I don't know whether I talk about the visuals, the music, the plot, the passion, the love, the drama, the losses or the wins. Lots of things happened and lots of things felt. The father- daughter thing , the belief, the well to live, the love, the desperation, the tough decisions and just so much is there to feel. I feel like if I lived another live. I really can't believe that I have waited ten years to watch the movie. But, I am so happy I did that. Because, in one of my hardest times, I found something to get me out of there and to take me to a better place. Amazing work!"
2024.05.02,9,"The story is set in a near-future Earth on the brink of environmental collapse. Matthew McConaughey stars as Cooper, a former astronaut turned farmer, who embarks on a daring mission through a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable planet for humanity's survival. As he traverses the vastness of space, Cooper grapples with the challenges of relativity, the mysteries of the universe, and the sacrifices required to ensure the future of humanity. Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, seamlessly blending grand spectacle with intimate character moments. The film's visual effects are awe-inspiring, depicting the wonders of space and celestial bodies in breathtaking detail. Nolan's meticulous attention to scientific accuracy and his ability to balance complex concepts with emotional storytelling create a truly immersive experience. Matthew McConaughey delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as Cooper, capturing the character's determination, vulnerability, and deep connection to his family. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, bring depth and authenticity to their respective roles, enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. Interstellar is a film that transcends the boundaries of traditional science fiction. While it explores mind-bending concepts such as time dilation and the nature of black holes, it also delves into universal themes of love, sacrifice, and the enduring human spirit. The screenplay, co-written by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, strikes a delicate balance between intellectual exploration and heartfelt storytelling. The film's technical aspects are nothing short of extraordinary. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography captures the vastness of space and the desolation of Earth with stunning visual compositions. Hans Zimmer's score, with its haunting organ arrangements and emotional crescendos, heightens the film's dramatic impact and adds another layer of depth to the storytelling. Interstellar is a cinematic experience that challenges the mind and stirs the heart. It invites audiences to ponder existential questions about the nature of time, the possibilities of space exploration, and the profound connections that bind us together. The film's blend of scientific exploration, breathtaking visuals, and emotional storytelling creates an unforgettable journey that resonates long after the credits roll. In conclusion, Interstellar is a mind-bending and emotionally resonant sci-fi epic that showcases Christopher Nolan's visionary storytelling. With its compelling performances, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking narrative, the film stands as a testament to the power of cinema to inspire and provoke contemplation. Interstellar is a must-watch for science fiction enthusiasts and anyone seeking a transcendent cinematic experience that explores the vastness of the universe and the depths of the human spirit."
2017.02.17,9,"A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch. Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic. Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind. Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching."
2022.11.27,10,"The best film in the history of cinema. The film makes you think about the meaning of life, about people close to you. The movie that will make you cry at the end of the story. If you have kids, you will love them even more after watching this movie. Christopher Nolan has created a film that will be the benchmark for every sci-fi director, and it probably won't get any better. Interstellar should have received every award that could be given. I never liked films of this genre. I chose it by accident, and I do not regret that I looked. The film goes on for a very long time, but it passes like a moment."
2019.09.12,10,"I have watched this film 3 times. Each time i discover something new. Not only about the story itself , but it also taught me alot about me and my life. If you watch this film , you will learn a alot abot our earth, solar system, other planets and other galaxies. Watch this , the cast is amazing, the visual effects and the music, THE MUSIC makes me wanna work for NASA. Nolan is a real deal"
2020.05.22,10,"This movie is a masterpiece, a pure example of art and how good a movie can be. I am typing this review at 1:45 AM during lock-down. Yeah I just watched it in 2020, somehow missed this beauty in 2014, but well; this movie is way way ahead of it's time, for the year 2020 as well. It felt really great to watch this."
2017.03.08,0,"I find this film to be overrated by those that are liking it and underrated by those that are hating it, the overall score now is over 8, it is a little bit too much, other movies better than this one (for instance 2001: A space Odyssey) have a lower score and is a bit unfair that this flick is on pair or slightly over in IMDb score over that film. The cast is a mixture of good and bad, Matthew McConaughey acting, for instance, is good, Anne Hathaway so and so, Matt Damon, again, so an so, John Lithgow is OK, Michael Caine is OK (but is too old for his part, the casting is an issue, I will add more on this topic), Jessica Chastain is OK, so is the younger Murphy portrayed by Mackenzie Foy but the older Murphy portrayed by Ellen Burstyn is unconvincing. The supporting cast is, for the most part, forgettable, unidirectional and cartoonish (for instance the robots, the son Tom, the crew etc.). The script/plot is the main issue of the film, from the beginning we are introduced in a future society that has crop/food/drought problems due to climate changes and mildew. But these problems could not be planetary as we know that our planet does not have just a continent and the climate on those five continents differs dramatically, for instance Siberia has a totally different climate that Australia or India. Again if you have climate problems in middle of USA chances are, in the real life, that in northern Canada these problems will turn in advantages on your part, so why not re-settle in more advantageous regions on Earth instead of going directly into deep space with plan A (the whole planetary population towards another galaxy!!), this is the first and the biggest hole in the main plot. The second major issue of the script is the whole NASA business, it is secret, but somehow have huge funding for deep space programs, the government (a Orwellian one, no more or less) denies that space is a priority but secretly invest in it (why? we don't know and the script writers have no idea, too) and finally in the whole world only NASA/USA have deep space programs, the others no, they do not bother with space and the film makers are not bothered with them, too. Finally, the whole gravity/physics/equation/wormhole/black hole thing is again a very big plot hole. Firstly the professor get to the conclusion that Plan A (the whole population in space thing) can't be done (duh!) and secretly arrange Plan B(embryos in Cryostasis) without the knowledge of the space crew. All the pseudo-scientific theories regarding the fabric of time, gravity,black holes etc. are improbable and unbelievable, I know, it is an SF,but this part of this plot is too much especially the ghost part and entering of the black hole thing, with the fabric of time manipulated and equation solved by Coop and Murph in a very bad written scene. On top of this plot holes add a whole lot of bad Hollywood clichés and bad casting choices (for instance professor Brand, a 80 year old Cockney has a 30 year American Jewish daughter, young Tom is a Midwestern boy that turn into an East Coast fellow in his 40s, old Murphy is English, the young and midlife are not etc.) The movie has good potential, some parts are good, with beautiful scenes, but is again a case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as in many big Hollywood movies lately. The idea and script had potential, the cast had too. The CGI effects are OK, do not expect a heavy fight flick with shoot the alien between the eyes at every 30 seconds, as in Edge of Tomorrow for instance, a truly bad, over the top SF, no, it is a more thinking man SF but ultimately it fails due to the bad plot/scenario. This movie was a good idea turned wrong, it is a 6, 6.5 grade at best!"
2014.11.22,7,"As a Sci-Fi fan, I looked forward to see this. The Earth in peril is not a new idea, and much of the film is derivative. 2001 and Contact come to mind. The acting is so-so. And the CGI is nothing special. It is also far too long, which I do not mind, if the film has the scope to need it. This one does not. Anne Hathaway: what is all the fuss about. Mathew is a fine actor, indeed one I did not like when first I saw him. The journey through the Wormhole was better done in Contact. And how come an ice cloud would not fall? The planets they reach are dull. Water without a sign of life. A frozen planet is not a place humans would like to settle. Then half way through I was completely baffled. (Spoiler alert). Why did Matt Damon's character rebel? Perhaps a revisit when on TV will clarify."
2024.05.02,10,"Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' is a breathtaking journey through the cosmos, blending dazzling visuals, mind-bending concepts, and emotional depth into a cinematic experience unlike any other. From its stunning depiction of space travel to its exploration of profound themes, this film captivates audiences from start to finish. At the heart of 'Interstellar' is its gripping story, which follows a team of astronauts on a daring mission to find a new home for humanity as Earth faces environmental collapse. Led by the brilliant Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, the crew ventures into the depths of space, encountering breathtaking wonders and unfathomable dangers along the way. Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary, seamlessly weaving together elements of science fiction, drama, and even philosophical speculation. His meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, from the meticulously researched depiction of black holes and wormholes to the hauntingly beautiful landscapes of distant planets. But what truly sets 'Interstellar' apart is its emotional resonance. Amidst the cosmic spectacle, the film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the bonds that connect us across space and time. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph, played with remarkable depth by Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy, forms the emotional core of the story, grounding the film in human experience amidst the vastness of the universe. Of course, 'Interstellar' is also a technical marvel, with groundbreaking visual effects that bring its otherworldly settings to life with breathtaking realism. Hans Zimmer's haunting score further elevates the film, heightening the tension and emotion of each scene with its powerful orchestration. While some viewers may find 'Interstellar's' ambitious narrative and complex themes challenging to follow, those who are willing to engage with its ideas will be rewarded with a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. In the end, 'Interstellar' is more than just a movie; it's a profound meditation on the human spirit and our place in the universe-a cosmic odyssey that transcends space and time."
2017.05.27,6,"Whoever the genius was that cast Matthew McConaughey as a super- intelligent astronaut, completely funked up what otherwise would have been a highly rated sci-fi drama. Sorry but brilliant scientific observations and explanations just don't sound credible coming from a typecast smooth talking lady's man sporting a redneck accent. It's awkward and I just couldn't get past it. Russell Crowe, George Clooney... anyone but Matthew McConaughey and this might have risen to the level of 'great.'"
2014.11.07,4,"Attention: there might be spoilers here, but otherwise it is just not possible to discuss the film, IMHO. So do not read further if you have not seen it yet. Actually it is the first Nolan film I see, and I am open-mouthed at the HUGE hype preceding it. The film does not fulfill the expectations in most ways. The worst is the insufferable dialogue, which forces good actors into ineptness, Matt Damon being a particularly sad example. The whole screenplay needed about twenty (thousand) revisions more. There are characters that are completely superfluous, so much that one gets killed without any repercussions in the plot at all. And they do not seem to have a use for the character Romilly, either, except getting older. The idea of the NASA chief being a villain is preposterous; why send people on a mission you know they are going to fail? And his own daughter? Since it is all secret, which gallery would he be playing to? (and mind you, Caine is one of the very very few convincing characters, the other ones being Ellen Burstyin and the robots). There are huge scientific errors too, in spite of Kip Thorne. To slow time so much in the water planet, the gravity would have to crush the astronauts in essentially the first instant. A solution would have been to have the planet (or the ship) move nearer the speed of light, but apparently nobody thought of that. Points are about as subtle as a kick in the stomach, and I fail to see why anybody would think the science is 'dense' and the film is 'complex'. Special effects are good. of course, but not as much as the hype says. And, sorry, if you get near a black hole, you would be thinned out like spaghetti by the enormous gravity. It is just impossible not only to survive, but to get out. The 'They' is just a 'Deus ex machina' to save the main plot from its own inepcy, and since this is all supposed to be so scientific, their appearance in the plot is completely arbitrary and illogical. And what, pray, would be these 'quantum data'? Since the quantic theory applies only in extremely small dimensions, why go look for it in space?. Somebody thought it sounded cute, I guess. There was no need to be realistic and scientific if we are getting out of the mire by miracle. The ending is maybe the best part, at times moving, but the notion that somebody who has been in hospital and will be let out only in 'a couple of days' can rush to a rocket and take off, without space suit, raining, or assistance, as if it was a bicycle, seems ridiculous. My first and last Nolan film, I suspect."
2019.10.19,10,"My favourite movie so far.Everything in this movie is perfect. I think that the essential element of this masterpiece is the music. Never again a music will match so well with a movie. At the end of the movie, my mind was blown away and I couldn't think about anything else. That's why we love movies!"
2020.09.09,10,"I don't know how could I explain my experience.If you are a human at least one,you should have to watch this movie.brillaiance at it's peak.I don't wanna say it's just a movie.Interstellar is more than a movie reality.Watch yourselves and think about this review Thankyou"
2024.04.24,9,"I know nothing about astrophysics or cosmology and I watched this film 10 years ago- I was 14. Throughout the years, I've lost count on how many times I have rewatched this movie. This film tackles about such a complex matter which involves knowledge about different branches of science. As a former 14-year-old sci-fi fanatic, this movie was laid out in such a way that people will understand. While science might not be everybody's thing, this film touches the subject of family and survival; something everyone can relate to. It's a great tear-jerking film that makes people question what they know about the universe and all the possibilities it offers. At some point of the film, it will also make you question your morals and empathize with the characters. Interstellar is a thought-provoking piece that I think is a must-watch for everyone, especially Sci-fi lovers."
2024.05.06,10,To be honest what attracted me in this movie was the soundtrack it's one of the most beautiful and amazing soundtracks I've ever heard and then i was like let's see what the movie is and thanks good i watched this everything is perfect literally everything the acting the cast the plot (it was a little hard to understand) the scenes were really good you can see how good are them I had mixed feelings I cried so much and i was surprised i didn't understand the plot from the first time but i did in the end that was one of the best experiences make sure that you watch this with high quality enjoyy.
2023.06.26,10,"The tempo is slow but the cinematography, acting and story are satisfying. It gives extra pleasure when watching scientifically correct. The most important part of this pleasure is the way they deal with the black hole (black hole - white hole), the explanation of the theory of relativity, the atmosphere created by the black hole while passing through it and the theory it put forward, you can hardly stand still while watching the processing of the planets and the travel to them. Lastly, his theory about creatures in the 4th dimension and the dramatic atmosphere that dominates the whole movie bring the movie to the top. My favorite nolan movie. You should definitely watch it."
2014.11.04,9,"I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because while it is not perfect because nothing is, I at least thought it was perfect for the genre. I also would like to not that a vote of 9.5 is impossible for some reason and I think that is insane. People say all the time sci-fi is a hard genre and I disagree. The truth of the matter is space is a hard subject to make an interesting movie about. In this movie the only problem is if you have seen Gravity you at least got to look at a beautiful woman on the screen for quite some time. This movie (I have to be honest) Anne Hathaway does not look her best. Which makes sense because how can someone expect to look like a top model while spending so much time in space? Any who I had the pleasure in seeing this movie in 70mmm IMAX film and let me say I highly recommend it. I wish all theaters or at least all of the people wanting to see this film could see it in 70mm. I felt like it was the way the movie was intended on being viewed. Overall great movie for the fans of space.  This movie is the dream of any kid that has ever dreamed of space. My second and last tip for those who have not seen the movie yet, is pay attention from the first minute to the last. You have to pay attention or you will miss something. Which we should all know by now since the Director is Christopher Nolan."
2023.11.07,0,"As I write this, I am listening to the soundtrack of my movie and lost in deep thought. No matter what I think, this is the first time I am writing such a comment, the movie is a masterpiece for me, it has aspects that attract emotional thought beyond perfection, the understanding of philosophy is very dominant, I can dive into deep thoughts, I have never been to that lonely night with such a movie in my life. I could not have guessed that I would be so impressed, the leading man does not allow me to write his name, he makes me experience his acting just like in real life. Reis, an actor I love very much, also appeared in the movie and managed to turn the movie into a masterpiece."
2018.03.10,7,"Interstellar is a good movie, I admit. But the relativity part of the film is very fictional and metaphysical. The film is overrated and doesn't deserve 8.5 rating."
2014.11.13,10,"This is easily one of the best movies I've seen in my life (and I'm not that young anymore!) Truly epic, basically this century's 2001 crossed with Gone with the Wind. The first stand out thing is that it gets the physics right. The second that if you have a child you will struggle to hold back the tears at some of the themes running through the movie. The third that it manages to span generations while never loosing sight of the plot or the characters' development. The fourth that after watching it you feel like you've sat through a tour de force and need a break just to process it all. To say any more would ruin the plot, but wow ... Just wow!"
2017.03.13,6,"One thing I learned from great movies is that they have their quality aspects proportional to each other. You imagine what you get if you have great acting and poor directing, or great directing and poor story, or great story and poor focus. What do we have in this movie? Great acting, great directing, great poetry, and absurd scientific claims, which kills the joy of watching the movie if you are a little aware of the principles of modern physics. If you are an artist or musician, or anyone who has no knowledge about quantum mechanics, relativity, and modern cosmology, you can go and watch this movie and enjoy its great poetry. If you, however, have some knowledge I warn you that you may feel distrust and disappointment to the whole story and start blaming all the actors and the director for making such serious efforts while the story is scientifically absurd. I mean if the director (and the rest) intend to create a sci-fi movie they must avoid too detailed and serious explanations of how things happens in the universe (with serious faces). This reflects their ignorance and spoils the poetry of the movie. I can bring few facts from the movie that is nonsense and they needed to avoid it. 1. A warm hole is a theoretical concept, and in practice no one even remotely knows what it is yet. 2. You may travel through a warm hole, but you cant direct yourself to a particular planet. 3. A black hole has several orders of magnitude more gravity and warmth than the sun, anything falling into it burns down and becomes about the size of an atom. The protagonist would be dead long before reaching its center. 4. And all this nonsense of looking to our particular earth from the black hole just because it has different dimensionality ... I don't even want to talk about it. 5. After 30 years their children needed to think about other life related things as well, and not sitting and talking about their father's mission all the time (be a bit realistic about life). 6. The biggest nonsense - after years father and daughter are meeting and just smiling and crying. This is not an American drama folks, the man has been in another galaxy and see the most unnatural thing in life: his daughter is 80 years old. They both should have been perplexed, got panic attack, feel extreme feelings, collapse or something. What the hell was that? A meeting with tears and smile? To sum up: The immensity of the universe and its effect on human aspect is is poorly explored. There should have been abnormal feelings going on in the move due to this, but we saw none!"
2025.09.09,2,"Who is the audience for this film? Its too faux intellectual for people who know anything about sci fi or science even, its not artistic in a 2001 vein for art film fans, its got 'action' that has zero emotional payoff or suspense, things just sort of happen randomly and all the actors are picture perfect pretty people, Renesme from Twilight and whatshisface the overrated actor with the French name who's in every film now are beyond bland and everyone speaks in dialogue so awkwardly expository it brings cringe to every scene and tableau. The 'tear jerk moments' are so bizarre and contrived they made me angry I see how this film appeals to Americans who find Chipotle smothered in Ranch to be the height of cuisine. This film is Chipotle smothered in Ranch."
2020.08.03,9,"This is a film that deals with cliched issues like Global decimation and overpopulation maybe not today but definitely in the foreseeable future. The space travel is the reason I watched the film. I had to watch this film once when it came out a second time immediately after it dropped on Blu Ray and streaming services and I still want to watch it a 3rd and 4th time just to experience the wonderful acting, cinematography and visuals again. Christopher Nolan knocked out of the ballpark definitely not his greatest movie ever but yeah I can see top 5 Inception and Dark Knight are better."
